"""A parked blocking prompt must be describable to a client that reconnects.

``_block`` emits its request EXACTLY once and keeps no replay buffer, and a turn
parked inside a blocking tool call is in no committed transcript (history is
written when a turn ENDS). So a client that cold-opens — or reloads into — a
waiting session had no way to learn the question, its choices, or the
``request_id`` an answer has to carry: the agent sat in ``_block`` until its
timeout while the UI could only show a contentless "waiting" dot, and the
clarify was unanswerable (MJXHRM-362).

Contract pinned here:

* ``_session_pending_prompt`` returns the payload ``_block`` actually emitted,
  scoped to the session that owns it, and nothing once it is released.
* ``_session_pending_kind`` — the eviction/liveness signal — still answers the
  same word off that one reader.
* ``session.resume``'s live payload carries it, and omits the key entirely when
  no prompt is parked.

Driven through the real ``_block`` rather than hand-seeded dicts: the whole
point is that what a resuming client gets back is what the original emit sent.
