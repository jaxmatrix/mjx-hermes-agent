"""Regression tests for terminal config -> env-var bridging.

terminal_tool._get_env_config() reads ALL terminal settings from os.environ
(TERMINAL_*).  config.yaml values therefore have to be bridged into env vars
at startup, by THREE separate code paths:

  1. cli.py            -> ``env_mappings`` dict (CLI / TUI startup)
  2. gateway/run.py    -> ``_terminal_env_map`` dict (gateway / messaging
                          platforms)
  3. hermes_cli/config.py:set_config_value
                       -> bridges via the canonical ``TERMINAL_CONFIG_ENV_MAP``
                          (one-shot when the user runs ``hermes config set …``)

If any one of these is missing a key, the corresponding config.yaml setting
silently does nothing for that entry-point.  This bug already shipped once
for ``docker_run_as_host_user`` (gateway and CLI maps) and once for
``docker_mount_cwd_to_workspace`` (gateway map).

This test guards against future drift by extracting all three maps via source
inspection and asserting they all bridge the same set of writable
``terminal.*`` keys.  Source inspection (rather than importing the live
dicts) keeps the test independent of the user's ~/.hermes/config.yaml and
mirrors the pattern used in tests/hermes_cli/test_config_drift.py.
