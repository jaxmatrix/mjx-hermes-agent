/**
 * Machine-level management-profile scope.
 *
 * One switcher (rendered in the sidebar) decides which profile every
 * management page reads/writes. React STATE is the source of truth; the
 * URL (`?profile=<name>`) is a synchronized projection of it so deep links
 * land scoped and refresh survives. The selection is mirrored into the api
 * module so `fetchJSON` transparently appends it to the profile-scoped
 * endpoint families. "" = the dashboard's own profile.
 *
 * Why state-first instead of URL-first: sidebar nav links are bare paths
 * (`/config`, `/skills`). A URL-derived scope would silently reset to the
 * dashboard's own profile on every nav click — the switcher would LOOK
 * global while normal navigation dropped the write target. With state as
 * truth, the effect below re-asserts `?profile=` onto the new location
 * after each navigation, so the scope survives nav and stays deep-linkable.
 *
 * This exists because "Set as active" on the Profiles page historically only
 * flipped the sticky active_profile file (future CLI/gateway runs). The
 * switcher is the dashboard's write-target selector for Chat and management
 * pages. We now sync the switcher when the sticky active profile differs from
 * the dashboard process on load, and ProfilesPage updates the switcher when
 * you click "Set as active".
