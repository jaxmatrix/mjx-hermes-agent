// MJXHRM-429 converted ~350 physical direction utilities to their logical
// equivalents so the app lays out right-to-left under `dir=rtl`. Nothing
// otherwise stops one growing back: `pl-2` is not a typo, `no-unknown-classes`
// resolves it happily, and it looks correct to anyone reading in English.
//
// Reported at `error`, never `warn`. A warning here runs and cannot fail, which
// is indistinguishable from the rule not being installed at all.
//
// Physical is still RIGHT in a few places, and each of those carries its own
// `eslint-disable-next-line` with the reason: a `left-1/2` paired with a
// physical `-translate-x-1/2` (that pair is centring, and already
// direction-agnostic), the popover arrow's rotated-square borders, and chrome
// floating over surfaces pinned left-to-right (code, diffs, logs, the
// terminal). Each is a judgement about one component, so it is written down
// there rather than blanket-ignored here.
//
// `(^|.*:)` not `^`: the rule reports a class with its whole variant chain
// attached, so `^pl-` would silently miss `group-hover:pl-2`. The greedy prefix
// is also what puts the FULL class name in `$0` for the message.
// The fourth column is the BOUNDARY after the physical head, and it is
// load-bearing: a bare `rounded-l(.*)` also matches `rounded-lg`, and
// `border-r(.*)` also matches `border-ring` — 59 false positives across the app
// the first time this table was written without it.
