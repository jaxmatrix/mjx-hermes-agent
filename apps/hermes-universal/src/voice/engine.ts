// loop and push-to-talk dictation — lease from here rather than each owning a
// recorder, which is what removes the "four recorder instances share one device"
// race. Rust's `already_open` is the backstop; this lease adds a synchronous,
// typed contention failure and a priority policy on top.
//
// Priority: a live conversation is a long-running mode and beats the momentary
// dictation button (dictation gets `VoiceBusyError`); a conversation starting
// while dictation is recording preempts it. Encoded once here rather than as
// ad-hoc try/catch at each call site.
