/**
 * The primary window's half of Quick Entry (MJXHRM-384).
 *
 * Both ways:
 *
 * - **Inbound** — text captured in the quick window is routed by target and
 *   submitted through THIS window's normal prompt machinery. The current chat
 *   rides the slash dispatcher when the text is a `/`-command and `sendPrompt`
 *   otherwise, exactly as the real composer does; a picked stored
 *   session rides the session-tile delegate (resume + submit, in the background,
 *   without moving the primary view — the same path a tiled session uses); "new
 *   session" is `startNewSession()` followed by the same `sendPrompt`, which is
 *   precisely what clicking New chat and typing does. One submit pipeline, no
 *   bespoke RPC.
 * - **Outbound** — connection phase and the recent-session list are pushed to
 *   the quick window, so its input disables with a reconnect hint whenever the
 *   backend is unreachable rather than accepting text it cannot deliver.
 *
 * Installed lazily from `openQuickEntry()` rather than mounted in a component
 * tree, for the reason `installHudHandoff` is: the window that summons the quick
 * window is by definition the window that must submit for it, so the summoning
 * call site is where the responsibility lives — and an app that never summons it
 * pays nothing. Idempotent, because summoning happens over and over and stacked
 * listeners would send one prompt N times.
 *
 * Never in a satellite or a tile window: a second window also claiming the
 * capture channel is the same one-keystroke-N-prompts bug, and desktop guarded
 * the identical shape with `isAuxiliaryWindow`.

 *
 * The app already has the right answer to "Enter while busy": the composer's
 * QUEUE (mod+Enter), which parks the text per session and auto-drains it on the
 * settle edge (`store/composer-queue.ts`, `use-composer-queue.ts`). Queueing
 * under `$activeSessionKey` is queueing under exactly the key the primary
 * composer reads — its `activeQueueSessionKey` IS that atom (the primary session
 * view's `$runtimeId`) — so the entry shows up in the queue panel and sends
 * itself when the turn ends.
 *
