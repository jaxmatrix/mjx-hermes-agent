/**
 * PREVIEW TILES — every open preview is a layout-tree pane, the preview analog
 * of session and route tiles.
 *
 * The preview used to be ONE pane holding its own tab strip: a second bar at a
 * different height from the zone's, with its own close menu and its own label
 * casing, welded next to the file tree and revealed by a visibility binding. It
 * predated the layout tree. Now `$previewTabs` mirrors into pane contributions
 * through the same `paneMirror` the other tiles use, so a preview tab IS a zone
 * tab — same strip, same drag / stack / split, same ✕, same right-click close
 * verbs, and one bar instead of two. The first open file claims a zone beside
 * the thread; every later one stacks into that zone's strip.
 *
 * The rail component survives for the shells that have no layout tree (the phone
 * Workspace's Editor tab and the narrow AppShell drawer); nothing in the tree
 * path goes through it.
