/**
 * THE SESSION MENU IS TWO MENUS (MJXHRM-409).
 *
 * The same component serves a SIDEBAR ROW and a TAB, and the tab verbs are the
 * only difference between them. That split was the reason this file hand-rolled
 * its own copy of the four close verbs — it is assembled from a SPEC LIST, and
 * the shared primitive only returned JSX until #118 split it into
 * `paneTabCloseSpecs` (data) + `paneTabCloseItems` (that data rendered).
 *
 * Nothing rendered this menu in any test. So neither half of what the migration
 * changed was held: that a row menu still grows no Close it cannot honour, and
 * that a tab menu ends with Reload plus the four shared verbs in the shared
 * order, DISABLED rather than dropped when they would close nothing.
