// Attachment staging (Gc8/R7). Pick a file → read bytes → data-URL → file.attach
// (which stages it server-side and returns a @file:/@image: ref) → the ref is
// spliced into the prompt text on submit (the desktop model).
//
// The read is CAPPED and it happens in Rust (`readCappedFileBase64` →
// `data_url_read_max.rs`), not here. `@tauri-apps/plugin-fs`'s `readFile` used
// to do it, which meant the base64 of an arbitrarily large file was allocated
// in the webview before anything could object — on a phone that is the system
// killing the process, so there was no error to show and no draft left to show
// it in. Rust refuses on the file's own size before allocating, and the same
// call resolves Android SAF `content://` URIs (which is why it goes through the
// fs plugin's `Fs::open` rather than `std::fs`). Settings ▸ Chat sets the cap.
//
// Every ref this module BUILDS goes through `refValue` (formatRefValue), which
// quotes a value the reference grammar would otherwise cut short. The gateway's
// pattern falls back to `\S+` for an unquoted value, so `@folder:/srv/my code`
// resolves `/srv/my` — a directory that often exists — and strands ` code` in
// the prompt as prose. `file.attach` already quotes on its side
// (`_format_ref_value` in tui_gateway/methods_prompt.py); these are the refs we
// mint ourselves, so they have to do the same.
