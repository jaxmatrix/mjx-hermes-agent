 * second, times every busy tab, for pixels nobody can see. Keep-alive without
 * it is a regression on the thing it was meant to fix.
 *
 * A hidden tab freezes its transcript and catches up in ONE commit on reveal,
 * because nanostores' `subscribe` fires immediately with the current value.
 * Status stays live throughout — `$busy` and the session-status atoms are
 * separate, cheap, and deliberately left subscribed, so a background tab's
