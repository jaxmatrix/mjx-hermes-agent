 * getting this wrong. Two bugs lived in it:
 *
 *  1. Shift+Enter was never claimed at all — it fell through to the webview's
 *     own `insertLineBreak`, whose DOM differs per engine, and the normalizer
 *     downstream then deleted the newline on WebKit (see
 *     `insertComposerLineBreak`). It has to be answered FIRST, ahead of the
 *     completion menu, which otherwise eats it: the accept test was `Enter ||
 *     Tab || space` with no `shiftKey` guard, so typing `@fi` and pressing
 *     Shift+Enter committed a chip instead of breaking the line.
 *  2. In the message-EDIT composer the send test was `Enter && !shiftKey` with
 *     no modifier guard, so ⌘+Enter — the queue chord everywhere else — resent
 *     the edited message outright, and that composer's send is destructive
 *     (it rewinds the conversation to that turn).
 *
 * The composer's real handler cannot be mounted in a unit test; this is the
 * whole of the decision it makes, so the rule is pinned here instead.
