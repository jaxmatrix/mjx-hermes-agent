/**
 * The composer's line breaks — who is allowed to delete one, and who is not.
 *
 * `normalizeComposerEditorDom` exists to throw away the block wrappers and
 * trailing `<br>`s a contenteditable invents when you edit around a
 * `contenteditable=false` chip. Those serialize as `\n` and visibly grow the
 * composer, so they have to go. The hazard is that a line break the USER asked
 * for is the same node, and for a long time the only thing separating the two
 * was shape — "a `<br>` after real text is real; a trailing block wrapper is
 * junk" — which is a statement about Chromium rather than about the web.
 *
 * WebKit (WKWebView on macOS/iOS, WebKitGTK on Linux) reaches for a block
 * wrapper where Chromium reaches for a bare `<br>`, so on those engines the junk
 * rule matched the newline the user had just typed and deleted it on the very
 * next flush. That is the whole of "Shift+Enter does nothing on macOS"
 * and it is why the composer now inserts its own TAGGED break
 * instead of inferring one: ownership is a fact about the node, not a guess
 * about the engine.
 *
 * These cases pin the discrimination in both directions. A regression that
 * loosened the tag check would fail the "junk is still junk" cases; one that
 * tightened the shape rules again would fail the WebKit ones.
