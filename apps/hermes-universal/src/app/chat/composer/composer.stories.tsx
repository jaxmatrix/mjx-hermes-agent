 *    Chrome and WebKit apply TOUCH ADJUSTMENT and snap a near-miss onto the
 *    editable, so those taps arrive with the editor as their `event.target` and
 *    are indistinguishable from a real one by target alone. The guard compares
 *    the pointer's COORDINATES to the editor's box instead.
 * 2. Tap anywhere in the text row, including its lower half. The keyboard must
 *    open — the row is one 48px editable box, not a short editor centred in a
 *    tall wrapper, precisely so there is no dead strip inside it.
 *
 * Also worth eyeballing here: every control and both rows are 48px
 * (`--touch-target-min`), so nothing in the bar is a small target.
