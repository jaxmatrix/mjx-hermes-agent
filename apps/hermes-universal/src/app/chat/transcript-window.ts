/**
 * Bound what reaches assistant-ui at all.
 *
 * Rendering the full transcript of an oversized session rebuilds an unbounded
 * runtime repository on every store update and exhausts the renderer's V8 heap
 * (#55191). The DOM budget in `thread/list.tsx` already bounds what PAINTS, but
 * every message still gets normalized into the repository first — so a session
 * only has to be heavy, not visible, to crash the window.
 *
 * The window spends the same currency as the DOM budget: render weight, not
 * message count. A count cap gets this wrong in both directions — measured on a
 * real 1,175-session store, a 400-message cap would disable itself on 37
 * sessions that are heavy but short (one was 133 messages / 1.05MB) while
 * engaging on 92 long-but-light sessions that were never at risk.
 */

/**
 * One window page, in render-weight units.
 *
 * Two DOM pages (the `RENDER_BUDGET` of 600 in `thread/list.tsx`). "Show
 * earlier" spends the DOM budget first, so the user pages through the
 * already-materialized window before this asks the store for more — and a
 * transcript heavy enough to exhaust the heap is windowed rather than handed
 * to the repository whole.
 *
 * A THIRD of that on a phone, because the cost that matters there is not heap
 * but PAINT. Traced on an iPhone opening a long code-heavy chat: interactions
 * reported `presentationMs` of 230/225/224 against `processingMs` of 20 or
 * less — the main thread was barely working, the compositor was rasterising a
 * very large tree — and the transcript stalled for ~2.8s across 63 dropped
 * frames. Every later invalidation repaints whatever this materialised, so the
 * window size is the multiplier on all of them.

 * (full markdown re-parse + re-highlight per row, a fresh `resetKey` for every
 * error boundary) and assistant-ui's message repository takes its O(window)
 * rebuild path instead of the one-message update. That — not the transcript's
 * size — is the long-session collapse: below the budget the window is
 * pass-through and streaming is O(1); the flush the transcript outgrew it,
 * every token cost a whole-window re-render. A budget meant to protect long
 * sessions made them slower at exactly the length it engaged.
 *
 * So the cut is anchored to a message id and holds while the tail stays within
 * budget + slack. Streaming then costs a re-cut once per ~half page of content.
 * The anchor vanishing (session swap, compression rewrite) or a pages change
 * ("Show earlier") falls through to a fresh walk.
