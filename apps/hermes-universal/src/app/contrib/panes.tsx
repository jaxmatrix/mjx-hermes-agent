/**
 * Real-data pane surfaces for the layout-tree contribution root.
 *
 * Universal difference from desktop's `app/contrib/panes.tsx`: universal's
 * surfaces are SELF-WIRED (each reads its own stores/hooks) rather than
 * prop-drilled through a controller `WiringActions` bag, so there is no
 * `WiredPane`/`WiringApi` indirection here — each pane contribution renders its
 * component directly. The workspace pane hosts the app's route table
 * (chat + full-page views); overlay routes (settings/command-center/…) still
 * render as MobileController portals over the shell, so they resolve to the
 * chat backdrop here.
