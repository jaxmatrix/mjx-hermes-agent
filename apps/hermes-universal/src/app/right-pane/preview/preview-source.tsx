/**
 * The preview pane's SOURCE view, rendered by this app end to end.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. It used to render through `react-shiki`, which is the same
 * library chain the fence rebuild removed from the chat fence after a signed iOS build
 * collapsed every line of a fence onto one line — see the header comment on
 * `components/chat/code-fence.tsx`, which is the post-mortem. Here the same
 * chain showed up as the other end of that failure: the pane came up EMPTY with
 * the toolbar still on `source`, and tapping Edit (CodeMirror, which owns its
 * own DOM and metrics) filled it correctly. Two symptoms, one cause — a lazy
 * chunk, a WASM engine and three elements whose tags, classes and inline styles
 * belonged to a library.
 *
 * So this follows the fence's four structural rules:
 *
 *  1. WE render the elements.
 *  2. Nothing between the `<pre>` and the text is third-party: `<pre>` →
 *     `<code>` → text, or `<pre>` → `<code>` → our own `<span>`.
 *  3. No selector we depend on targets a third-party attribute. (The
 *     `.preview-source-code .shiki` block in styles.css did exactly that, was
 *     never applied by any component, and is deleted — its row metrics are the
 *     inline styles below.)
 *  4. Anything whose absence makes the view UNREADABLE OR GEOMETRICALLY WRONG
 *     is an INLINE STYLE. Font SIZE stays a class: a miss there is ugly, not
 *     unreadable.
 *
 * And the fence's fifth: colour is computed synchronously by `lib/code-tokens`,
 * so there is no chunk, no engine and no async state — hence no empty state to
 * fall into. A language that module has no grammar for is not an error; it
 * renders as plain, complete text, which is what this whole view degrades to.
 */

/**
 * Inline for the reasons in the fence's header: a class can be purged by content
 * detection, rewritten by Lightning CSS, out-ranked by a cascade layer, or
 * scoped to a selector that quietly stops matching.
 *
 * `white-space: pre` is the whole bug, so it is set HERE and again on the
 * `<code>`. `word-break`/`overflow-wrap` INHERIT, so they are pinned rather than
 * left to an ancestor. `line-height` is the fixed editor row height the deleted
 * `.preview-source-code` rules used to supply, so source⇄diff toggling does not
 * shift. Unlike the transcript's fence this `<pre>` IS the pane's scroller —
 * both axes, and no wrapper scroller around it, because a scroller inside a
 * scroller was part of the DOM the iOS fence collapse was fighting.
