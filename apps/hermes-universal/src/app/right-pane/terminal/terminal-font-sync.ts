//
// `terminal.font_family` lives in the profile config, but the thing that RENDERS
// it is `$terminalFontFamily` — an in-memory atom, one copy per WebView, fed by
// whichever surface in that WebView happens to hold the shared config-record
// query. Every surface the app opens is its own WebView running its own copy of
// the bundle, and the two halves of this setting do not always land in the same
// one:
//
//   • On Android, Settings IS a separate WebView (`?win=activity`, MJX-141) while
//     the terminal lives in the chat activity. Typing a font there changed
//     nothing the user could see.
//   • A detached tile window (`?win=tile`) can host the terminal pane itself
//     (app/contrib/controller.tsx registers it), so the pane being re-faced is in
//     a different WebView from the picker doing the re-facing.
//   • The same window split also means an out-of-band `config.yaml` edit picked
//     up by ONE surface's revalidation never reached the others.
//
// So the writer announces and every other WebView adopts — the same shape, and
// the same reasoning, as themes/appearance-sync.ts (a `storage` listener is a
// Chromium-renderer trick universal cannot use; the Tauri event bus is the
// portable equivalent already proven there).
//
// Wired by a side-effect import in main.tsx, like the sync it mirrors.
