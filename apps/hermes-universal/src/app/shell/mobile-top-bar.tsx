// below the notch. First increment hosts only the left-sidebar toggle button;
// more buttons (search / settings / …) are added here later.
//
// `titleBar.left` / `titleBar.right` are mounted here too, so a plugin chip lands
// on the phone exactly as it does in the desktop titlebar. `titleBar.center` is
// deliberately NOT mounted: on mobile ChatTitle owns all the middle slack (there
// is no header row), and a contributed node there would fight it for width.
