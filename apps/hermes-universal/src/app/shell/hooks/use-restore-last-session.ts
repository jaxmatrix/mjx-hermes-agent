// session and the conversation you were in the middle of was three taps deep in
// the sidebar. `store/session` records the last real session id on every switch;
// this spends it, once.
//
// It has to wait for the gateway, because opening a session is a `session.resume`
// round trip — running it at mount would just fail. And it must fire ONCE per
// launch: a later reconnect (a gateway switch, a dropped socket) also brings the
// phase back to `ready`, and re-running there would drag the user out of whatever
// chat they had since opened.
