// Ported from apps/desktop/src/app/shell/hooks/use-overlay-routing.ts. Overlay
// views (settings / command-center / agents / cron / profiles / starmap) render
// as full-screen portals over the chat backdrop rather than routed panes, so the
// router only carries which one is open. A single `returnPathRef` stashes the
// underlying path while no overlay is open, so closing any of them returns there
// instead of bouncing to `/`.
//
// Seam vs desktop: universal's Settings has nested routes (`/settings/gateway`,
// …) which `appViewForPath` maps to 'chat', so settings is matched by prefix.
// Desktop's contributed-plugin ('extension') view has no universal equivalent.
