/**
 * MJXHRM-303 — PROOF that `StatusbarItemView`'s memo can hit.
 *
 * The ticket asks for the bippy render counter. That needs a dev build, which
 * this agent cannot run, and bippy is only verified to LOAD under WebKitGTK, not
 * to REPORT. So the claim is pinned here instead, which is strictly stronger as
 * a regression guard: it runs in CI on every push and fails loudly the day
 * someone reintroduces a fresh item literal.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING TESTED, precisely — because it is easy to test the
 * wrong thing here and come away reassured:
 *
 * `StatusbarItemView` is memoized on reference equality of `item`. So the memo
 * hits exactly when an item object KEEPS ITS IDENTITY across a re-render of the
 * hook. That is the property asserted below.
 *
 * It is NOT the same as "the bar does not re-render". `useStatusbarItems`
 * subscribes to ~20 stores, so the component hosting it still re-renders on any
 * of them — that is by design and unchanged by this ticket. What changes is that
 * its 13 children no longer re-render with it. Counting commits of the whole
 * subtree would therefore measure the parent and prove nothing, which is the
 * trap this file exists to avoid.
