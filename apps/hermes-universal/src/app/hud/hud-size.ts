 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE CARD. On the plain-toplevel path the
 * card is `h-full` — it IS the window's inner box — so a resize driven by the
 * card's own height is a fixed point that can never grow past where it already
 * is. What has to be measured is what the content WANTS, which is independent
 * of the window: the input bar (`[data-slot='composer-root']`) and the natural
 * height of the transcript (`[data-slot='aui_thread-content']`, the content box
 * inside the scroller, not the scroller).
