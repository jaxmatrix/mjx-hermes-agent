/**
 * Every window root, plus the surfaces that must exist in ALL of them.
 *
 * `RemoteFolderPicker` is one such surface: it is not a view, it is the
 * registration that gives `selectDesktopPaths` / `selectRemotePaths` somewhere
 * to send a pick. Unregistered, both resolve `[]`, which every caller reads as
 * "cancelled" — so the composer's `Files… ▸ Remote…`, Settings ▸ Archived's
 * "choose folder" and Profiles ▸ import were dead clicks in exactly the roots
 * that skip `ContribController`: the detached tile window, the HUD, and the
 * Android/iOS activity screen (which IS the Settings/Profiles surface there).
 *
 * `FindBar` (MJXHRM-387) is the second. It used to mount inside
 * `MobileController` only, so ⌘F searched the main shell and nothing else —
 * dead in a detached chat window showing a whole transcript, dead in the HUD
 * holding the same conversation, dead on the Android activity screen. It renders
 * nothing until opened and carries its own accelerator where no dispatcher
 * exists, so mounting it per window is free.
 *
 * `WakeIndicatorOverlay` (MJXHRM-389) is the fourth, for the same reason as
 * `FindBar`: it renders nothing until "Hey Hermes" fires, and the window that
 * armed the detector is not necessarily the one the app shell is in. Mounting it
 * per root costs one atom subscription and removes the question entirely.
 *
 * `CloseConfirm` (MJXHRM-390) is the third, and it was the same mistake one
 * level down: the "close a working chat?" gate mounted inside
 * `ContribController`, i.e. only in the DOCKED TILE TREE. A phone renders
 * `MobileShell` and a narrow window renders `AppShell`, so on both the gate
 * could park a pending close and nothing would ever draw the question — which
 * is why the mobile bubble strip dropped a chat mid-turn without asking.
 *
 * `BackgroundCloseDialog` is the fifth, and it is the same shape as
 * `CloseConfirm`: the WINDOW close guard is installed at boot for any window
 * that owns the app's persisted state, so the surface that answers it has to
 * exist wherever that guard does. A window whose shell forgot it would park the
 * first close and never draw the question, which is a dead titlebar button.
 *
 * `ConfirmHost` (MJXHRM-479) is the sixth, and it is the strongest case of all:
 * `confirm()` is called from plain async handlers and store actions that have no
 * component of their own, so the promise is parked with NOTHING on screen unless
 * a host is mounted in that window. A settings panel, a command-center action
 * and a sidebar row each reach it from a different shell, so the shell level is
 * again one level too low.
 *
 * Mounted HERE rather than once per root so the next root cannot forget them —
 * the failure mode is silence, which is the kind that ships.
