// Universal keeps ONE message type across the app: the `{ role, parts }`
// ChatMessage over the assistant-ui parts vocabulary (text / reasoning /
// tool-call), so converting to assistant-ui messages in app/chat/runtime.tsx is
// trivial.
//
// These helpers used to live in `store/chat.ts`, which made them unreachable
// from anything `store/chat.ts` itself imports. The unified session reducer
// (store/session-reducer.ts) applies exactly this logic to EVERY session's
// slice, so it has to be importable from a module with no store dependencies.
// Everything here is pure and side-effect free; `store/chat.ts` re-exports the
// whole surface so existing import sites keep working.
