/**
 * The portable half of find-in-page (MJXHRM-387).
 *
 * Linux drives WebKitGTK's own `WebKitFindController` from Rust — highlight-all,
 * engine-accurate counts, no JavaScript involved. Every other target reaches its
 * engine's find only through a native binding this Linux host cannot compile,
 * and on macOS/iOS that binding would buy nothing at all: `WKWebView`'s public
 * `findString:configuration:completionHandler:` answers a single
 * `WKFindResult.matchFound` boolean — the same answer `window.find` already
 * gives, minus a count. See `src-tauri/src/find_in_page.rs` for the per-platform
 * ledger.
 *
 * So the fallback is the one search primitive every engine already ships:
 * `window.find`. It is non-standard but implemented in both WebKit (macOS, iOS)
 * and Blink (Windows WebView2, Android WebView), it selects and scrolls the
 * match for us, and it costs no new Rust and no new crates.
 *
 * **Counting is separate from navigating, on purpose.** `window.find` reports
 * only "did I find one more", so counting with it means walking the whole
 * document and dragging the viewport along to every match before jumping back —
 * visible thrash on a long transcript. The count instead comes from a text scan,
 * which touches no selection and moves nothing.
 *
 * **The scan mirrors how an engine reads the page, not how the DOM is nested.**
 * An engine flattens each inline run into one string before matching, so
 * `<span>foo</span><span>.bar</span>` — every Shiki-highlighted code token, every
 * bold word inside a sentence — is one searchable run. A per-text-node scan
 * would count `foo.bar` as zero matches while `window.find` selected and scrolled
 * to it, and the bar would read `0/0` over a highlighted hit. Blocks and `<br>`
 * end a run, so text either side of a paragraph break never fuses into a match
 * that isn't there.
 *
 * What it still cannot see, on every platform including Linux:
 *   - transcript turns the render budget has UNMOUNTED (`thread/list.tsx` drops
 *     the head of a long conversation from the DOM entirely);
 *   - anything inside an `<iframe>` — artifact previews, URL/YouTube/Spotify
 *     embeds. `window.find` is called with `searchInFrames=false` because a
 *     cross-origin frame cannot be searched anyway and a same-origin one would
 *     move a viewport we do not own;
 *   - the terminal, which xterm paints to a WebGL canvas — there is no text
 *     there to find;
 *   - text drawn by a plugin into a shadow root.

 * added to this transcript to avoid. The list covers what actually wraps text
 * here (Shiki token spans, markdown emphasis/links/code, KaTeX spans); a `span`
 * a stylesheet has made `display:block` would fuse two runs, which over-counts
 * by a hair rather than under-counting to zero.
