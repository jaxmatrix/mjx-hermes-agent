// Ported from apps/desktop/src/lib/desktop-fs.ts — its REMOTE branch only.
// Desktop reads the filesystem through Electron when it owns the disk and falls
// back to the dashboard REST API (`/api/fs/*`) whenever the gateway is remote.
// Universal is always the remote case: the gateway owns the workspace, so every
// read/write here is REST and `isDesktopFsRemoteMode()` is unconditionally true.
//
// The three local-only Electron operations (reveal in the OS file manager,
// rename in place, move to trash) have no REST equivalent. They throw a clear
// error rather than silently no-op'ing; callers already gate them on
// `isDesktopFsRemoteMode()`, which is exactly how desktop hides them on a
// remote gateway.

// Mirrors desktop's HermesSelectPathsOptions (global.d.ts).
