/**
 * The crash-survivable in-flight turn journal.
 *
 * The gateway keeps its own `inflight` snapshot, and that covers a RECONNECT:
 * the socket drops, the backend keeps running, and `session.resume` hands the
 * turn back. It does not cover the app dying, because that snapshot is
 * text-only — `{user, assistant}` strings — and because a hard crash of the
 * backend takes it with it.
 *
 * This is the other half. While a turn is live, the visible tail of it — the
 * prompt, any corrections, and the streaming assistant row WITH its reasoning
 * and tool calls — is written to localStorage. On the next resume it is folded
 * back onto whatever the backend returns, so a turn killed mid-run comes back
 * as what the user was watching rather than a blank gap.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort by design: a storage failure must never break
 * a live turn.
