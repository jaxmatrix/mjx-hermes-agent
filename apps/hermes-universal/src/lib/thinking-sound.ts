// Ambient "thinking" sound for a voice conversation. While the agent works
// (status === 'thinking') no audio flows at all, which — hands-free, not looking
// at the screen — reads as "it died" through a long tool stretch. A calm, quiet,
// repeating pair of soft bubble blips fills that dead air.
//
// Ported from apps/desktop/src/lib/thinking-sound.ts. Same WebAudio oscillator
// synthesis as universal's wake-sound.ts / completion-sound.ts (no asset to
// ship), and the same two gates: the shared sound mute ($hapticsMuted) and the
// backend's own `voice.thinking_sound` config key ($thinkingSoundEnabled,
// default true — hermes_cli/config_defaults.py:1624). The pitches match the
// backend's numpy-synthesized blips in tools/voice_mode.py so the CLI, desktop
// and universal all sound alike.
//
// WHO DRIVES IT — universal's voice loop is a module-level actor, not a React
// effect (MJX-96), so the driver is `syncThinkingSound`, subscribed to
// `$voiceConversation` by the conversation controller. Desktop's equivalent is a
// `useEffect` in its composer hook; here a re-render is not a state transition
// and must not be one, or a conversation that blips forever is one missed render
// away.

 * speech), and `idle`/inactive (the conversation ended). Muting the conversation
 * stops them too: a muted conversation is one the user has stepped away from.
