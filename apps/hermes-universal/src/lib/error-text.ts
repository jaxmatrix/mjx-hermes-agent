/**
 * Turn an unknown thrown value into something worth showing a person.

 * `invoke` does not reject with an `Error` — it rejects with whatever the
 * command's error type serialised to, and ours serialise to objects
 * (`SshError` is `{ kind, message }`). `String({...})` is `"[object Object]"`,
 * so the one place a real diagnosis was available rendered as the least
 * informative string in JavaScript.
 *
 * Order matters: `message` is checked before falling back to stringifying,
 * because that is the field every error shape in this app actually carries.
