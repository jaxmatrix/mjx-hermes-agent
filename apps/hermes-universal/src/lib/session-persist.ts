// Gateway-session persistence across launches (D4/R2b). The reqwest cookie jar
// that carries the OAuth/cloud session lives in Rust and is in-memory only, so
// without this the login is lost on every app restart. We serialize the jar out
// of Rust (`cookies_export`) into the OS keyring, and rehydrate it back in
// (`cookies_import`) once on launch before the first connect.
//
// Both directions are best-effort: a missing keyring (browser dev / non-mobile
// before the D6 desktop-gate flip) simply degrades to no-persistence — the user
// signs in again — never a crash.

/**
 * The jar as the keyring currently holds it, as far as this process knows.
 *
 * `persistSessionCookies` runs on every transition to `ready` — every reconnect,
 * every gateway switch, every resume — and the jar is usually byte-identical to
 * the one already stored. Writing it anyway is not free: on every platform but
 * macOS a keyring write is its own round trip to the OS store. (On macOS the
 * write lands in the sealed vault instead — see src-tauri/src/secrets/vault.rs —
 * so it no longer costs a dialog there. Everywhere, skipping an unchanged write is
 * still the right thing to do.)
 *
 * Compared here rather than in Rust deliberately. The serialized jar is already
 * in hand at this point, whereas a Rust-side comparison would have to READ the
 * stored value first — spending the very round trip this exists to avoid.
 *
 * Process-local, and only ever suppresses a write of the SAME bytes, so the worst
 * a stale value can do is let one redundant write through.
