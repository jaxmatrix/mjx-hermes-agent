 *  - committed history, which only exists once the turn has finished.

 * snapshot overwriting structured rows, a flat dump sandwiched between them, an
 * optimistic user turn rendered a second time because the persisted copy came
 * back with its `@file:` line rewritten, a finished reply rendered twice
 * because history caught up mid-turn.
 *
 * These are protocol-shape problems, not renderer problems, which is why they
 * live in a leaf module the reducers and the hydration path both read rather
 * than being re-derived at each call site.

 * into the slice for its whole duration. Bailing out there left the shorter
 * gateway dump as the paired row while `preserveLocalPendingTurnMessages` could
 * no longer recognise our longer copy as the same answer, so it appended it:
