/**
 * User-installed themes registry — the extensibility seam the theme context
 * reads for `availableThemes` and every skin lookup, so an installed theme shows
 * up wherever a built-in does (the theme picker + `/skin`) with no per-surface
 * wiring.
 *
 * Ported from apps/desktop/src/themes/user-themes.ts, including the Marketplace
 * import surface (`marketplaceIdOf`, `$marketplaceInstalls`) — search + install
 * run through `store/marketplace.ts` and `app/settings/appearance-section.tsx`.
 * The registry is localStorage-backed. `atom` routes through the `@/store/atom`
 * seam.
 *
 * The one unexposed path is `installVscodeThemeFromText` (`themes/install.ts`),
 * which has no UI call site — there is no paste-JSON or file-picker surface.
 * Desktop has none either, so this is parity-neutral, not a gap.
