/**
 * The plugin authoring contract. A plugin is a file that default-exports a
 * `HermesPlugin`; it never touches the registry directly — it receives a
 * scoped `PluginContext` whose `register` auto-tags provenance
 * (`source: 'plugin:<id>'`) and namespaces the contribution id
 * (`<id>:<localId>`), so authors write plain contributions and collisions
 * between plugins are impossible.
 *
 * Bundled plugins live in `src/plugins/<name>/plugin.tsx` and are discovered by
 * `discoverBundledPlugins()` (contrib/plugins.ts) — no import, no registry edit.
 * Runtime-loaded plugins (disk / gateway) drive the SAME contract through
 * contrib/runtime-loader.ts.
 *
 * SECURITY: this is error isolation, not a capability boundary. A plugin runs in
 * the webview realm with the app's full authority; the id scoping below prevents
 * ACCIDENTAL collisions, not deliberate reach.
