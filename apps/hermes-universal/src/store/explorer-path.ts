/**
 * ONE action for "the user chose this folder in the explorer", and one source
 * of truth behind it.
 *
 * There used to be two. `$fileTreeRootOverride` was a view-only root that beat
 * `$effectiveCwd` outright, so Home re-rooted the tree while the session kept
 * working elsewhere, and — because an active override could not be seen
 * through — a real cwd change arriving later could not move the tree back. Both
 * directions were broken by the same atom, so the atom is gone.
 *
 * What is left is the cwd itself. Explorer → cwd is `session.cwd.set`; cwd →
 * explorer already worked and still needs no code (`session.info` → the session
 * slice → `$focusedCwd` → `$effectiveCwd` → the tree). Nothing here sets a tree
 * root, and nothing should: the tree's root IS the cwd now.
 *
 * The branching lives in `store/explorer-path-decision` (rule 35); this module
 * is the atoms, the RPC and the notifications.
