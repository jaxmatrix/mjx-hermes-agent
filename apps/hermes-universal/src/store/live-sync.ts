/**
 * Event-driven "backend data changed" signals — the gateway-side twin of
 * `store/workspace-events`.
 *
 * The gateway runs ONE change watcher (`tui_gateway/server.py`
 * `_broadcast_watched_changes`) over a table of cheap on-disk signatures and
 * broadcasts `pet.changed` / `cron.changed` / `sessions.changed` /
 * `platforms.changed` / `pairing.changed` the moment one moves.
 * `store/event-router.ts` routes them here, and the surfaces that used to poll
 * subscribe to these ticks — so they refresh exactly when the backend acts and
 * stay idle otherwise. On mobile that is the difference between a radio waking
 * every few seconds forever and one that wakes when something happened.
 *
 * `$changeEventsAvailable` is the compat gate: `gateway.ready` advertises
 * `change_events: true` on a backend that broadcasts. Consumers keep their old
 * poll as a SLOW backstop when it is true, and at the legacy cadence when it is
 * false (an older gateway) — so nothing goes dark mid-upgrade, and a missed
 * broadcast is still eventually corrected.
 *
 * Ported from apps/desktop/src/store/live-sync.ts. Unlike desktop, no profile
 * filtering is applied: this fork's watcher broadcasts through
 * `_broadcast_global_event`, which builds its frame with an empty session id and
 * stamps no `profile`, so desktop's `!event.profile || …` guard is always true
 * on these frames anyway.

/**
 * The gateway's plugin directory moved (MJXHRM-416).
 *
 * WIRED BUT NEVER FIRED, deliberately and visibly: the gateway's change-watcher
 * table (`tui_gateway/server.py` `_broadcast_watched_changes`) has five
 * signature rows and none of them is the plugin directory, so nothing emits
 * `plugins.changed` today. Adding one is a NEW backend push event, which the
 * shared-gateway freeze forbids — so 455 lands the client half and a post-freeze
 * ticket adds the row, with no client change needed on that day.
 *
 * The user-visible symptom 416 was filed about is already covered meanwhile:
 * `contrib/plugin-disk.ts`'s 2 s local poll reconciles membership on its own.
 * This is the cheaper path, not the only one.
