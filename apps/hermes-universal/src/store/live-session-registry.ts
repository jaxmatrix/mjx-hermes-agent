/**
 * LIVENESS FOR SESSIONS THIS CLIENT HAS NEVER OPENED — a LEAF module, so both
 * the producer (`store/live-session-status.ts`, which pulls
 * `session.active_list`) and the consumers (`store/session.ts`'s sidebar
 * projections) can read it without closing a cycle.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A SESSION SLICE. The snapshot's job is to light up a row for a
 * session running somewhere else — a cron tick, an inbound messaging turn, the
 * TUI, or the crash continuation the gateway scheduled while this app was dead.
 * That used to be done by publishing a `$sessionKeyStates` slice for the stranger,
 * seeded from the snapshot alone: no transcript, no `session.resume`, no
 * transport bound to this webview.
 *
 * That slice was indistinguishable from a hydrated one. It carried a
 * `storedSessionId`, so `publishSessionState` indexed it, so
 * `runtimeKeyForStoredSession` resolved to it — and BOTH warm short-circuits
 * (`store/session.ts#openSession` and the tile delegate's
 * `resumeSessionToState`) take a resolved key as "this conversation is already
 * whole, there is nothing to fetch". Opening such a session therefore adopted an
 * EMPTY slice: no transcript, no runtime binding, no `hydrating: → runtime`
 * rekey — and so none of what that rekey is the seam for (live-tail
 * reconciliation, crash-journal recovery, `adoptResumedTurn` putting the session
 * into `$inflightTurns` where reconnect reconciliation can find it).
 *
 * The case where the gateway reports a session live and the app has no slice for
 * it is, by construction, the case right after a crash — which is exactly the
 * case MJXHRM-356's crash recovery exists for. So the stub defeated the feature
 * precisely when it was needed.
 *
 * Liveness is a projection, not a session. It lives here.
