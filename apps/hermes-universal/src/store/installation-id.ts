// This install's stable identity (MJX-55).
//
// SSH gateway mode names its remote state directory after sha256(installationId,
// profile) and the remote backend echoes that back as an ownership proof. So the
// value has one hard requirement: it must be the SAME on every launch.
//
// Losing it is not a fresh start — it ORPHANS remote backends. The next connect
// computes a different ownership id, does not recognize the lockfile left on the
// remote, and therefore neither reuses that backend nor cleans it up. It just
// keeps running on someone else's machine with nothing pointing at it.
//
// Desktop has an installation-ID file for this (electron/desktop-installation.ts);
// universal has no main process, so it lives in the OS keyring with a
// localStorage mirror. The mirror is what makes a keyring that is merely
// *unavailable* (a Linux box with no Secret Service running, a browser dev
// session) non-destructive: we fall back to the mirror rather than minting a new
// identity and stranding whatever the old one owned.
