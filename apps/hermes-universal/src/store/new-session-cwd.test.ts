/**
 * MJXHRM-393: a fresh chat opened detached from the project the user was
 * standing in.
 *
 * The first pass resolved the scope at TWO call sites (⌘N and ⌘T) and left the
 * resolver returning `''` for both "Home, detached on purpose" and "no opinion,
 * use the configured default dir". Two things followed from that, and both are
 * pinned here:
 *
 *  - the mobile bubble strip's new chat never came through either call site, so
 *    ⌘N on a phone stayed detached from the project exactly as before;
 *  - the Home branch was DEAD. `''` fell through to the configured default dir
 *    in `resetChat`, and again in `ensureSession` on first send.
 *
 * So these tests deliberately assert the COMPOSED result — the directory the
 * draft slice ends up with, and the one `session.create` is actually called with
 * — not just the resolver's return value. Testing the resolver alone is what let
 * the Home branch ship broken.
