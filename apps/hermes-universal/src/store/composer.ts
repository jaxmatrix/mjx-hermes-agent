// A half-typed message has to survive moving between windows: summon the HUD
// mid-sentence and the sentence should be there; dismiss it and the main
// composer should have whatever you added. Every window here is its own webview
// with its own JS heap, and the TEXT travels through `localStorage`, which
// windows of one origin share.
//
// What does not travel through `localStorage` is the NEWS that it changed. The
// original port took desktop's `window.addEventListener('storage', …)`, which is
// sound in Electron — Chromium renderers of one origin all get it — and is a bet
// everywhere else: cross-process `storage` delivery is a WebKitGTK / WebView2 /
// Android-WebView implementation detail, and on Android the "windows" are
// activities in one process (MJXHRM-141) with no second renderer to notify. A
// bet that loses is silent — `reloadPersistedDrafts` simply never runs and the
// other surface keeps the copy it read at module init.
//
// So under Tauri the news rides the event bus (lib/webview-broadcast.ts), the
// same shape themes/appearance-sync.ts and terminal-font-sync.ts already use for
// "one webview changed something global". `storage` stays as the WEB fallback
// and ONLY there: running both would make "did the new transport work?"
// unanswerable, which is exactly how the old one shipped unverified.
//
// Two directions, because the two moments of a handoff are not symmetric:
//
//   • CHANGED is an announcement. It needs no acknowledgement — the text is on
//     disk, so a peer that misses the news still picks it up the next time it
//     consults the stash. Missing it costs a repaint, not a draft.
//   • FLUSH is a request, and it is the one that can lose text: a window another
//     window tears down runs no JS on the way out (see store/windows.ts — that
//     is why both the satellite and the tile close signals come from Rust), so
//     nothing writes down what was typed since its last debounce unless it is
//     ASKED to, and asked in time. Hence the acknowledgement:
//     `requestPeerComposerFlush` can tell "that window wrote its draft down"
//     from "nobody answered", and says which. Two callers today: dismissing the
//     HUD, and reattaching a detached tile.
//
// What this does NOT promise on Android: a webview whose activity Kotlin has
// already finished runs nothing, so an event cannot reach it and a draft held
// only in that heap is gone before any transport is involved. The guarantee here
// is between LIVE webviews of one process, which is what the desktop `storage`
// listener never gave at all.
//
// Attachments do not travel either way. They are blobs and upload state held in
// memory, and only draft TEXT is mirrored to storage.
