/**
 * Writing the composer down before a window is built (MJXHRM-398).
 *
 * Every window kind here boots the app, and the app seeds its per-session drafts
 * from `localStorage` as it mounts. That stash is only ever as current as the
 * last debounced write — 400 ms — so unless the window ORDERING a new one writes
 * its editor down first, the new window opens on the sentence as it stood a
 * moment ago and the rest is gone.
 *
 * `app/hud/hud.ts` was the only opener that had ever done this. Three others had
 * not, which is the defect: tearing a tile off, popping a chat out, and opening
 * a new instance window. So the assertions here are all about ORDER — the flush
 * has to be on the wire before `invoke` is, not merely somewhere in the function
 * — and about the guards, because a window that is never built must leave no
 * trace in the shared stash.
 *
 * The addressing half (`addressesThisWindow`) is at the bottom: it is what lets
 * a peer flush reach a DETACHED TILE window, which is not a satellite and so had
 * no address at all before this.
