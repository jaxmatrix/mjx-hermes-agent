/**
 * Reconcile the sidebar's pins with the backend "keep" flag, both directions.
 *
 * Pins drive the sidebar UI out of `$pinnedSessionIds` (localStorage), but the
 * durable record is `sessions.pinned` in each profile's state.db. That flag is
 * what a pin MEANS server-side, and two things depend on it that no client-side
 * list can reproduce:
 *
 *  - the `sessions.auto_archive` sweep runs backend-side and skips pinned rows
 *    (`hermes_state.py` `archive_stale_sessions`), so a pin the backend cannot
 *    see is a chat the sweep is free to hide — the pin silently failing at its
 *    one job;
 *  - both list endpoints back-fill pinned conversations past their LIMIT
 *    (`include_pinned=True`), so a pinned chat stays reachable however far it
 *    has aged out of the recency window.
 *
 * It is also the only pin channel every client shares. Desktop has mirrored
 * here since `feat(desktop): pins sync between apps sharing a gateway`; a
 * gateway-side list of ids that only Universal writes converges Universal with
 * Universal and with nothing else.
 *
 * Push: PATCH `pinned` whenever the local set changes, and re-assert the whole
 * set at boot — which transparently migrates pre-existing local pins with no
 * user action.
 *
 * Pull: session rows carry `pinned`, and the list endpoints back-fill pinned
 * conversations past their LIMIT, so a row's absence from a page no longer says
 * anything about its pin state. That makes the server row authoritative: adopt
 * pins this app hasn't seen, and drop local pins the server says are gone. Only
 * rows actually present in the payload are consulted, so a backend predating
 * the flag (`pinned === undefined`) leaves the local set untouched — and a page
 * that predates one of our own writes is fenced out until a later page confirms
 * the value we wrote.
 *
 * Ported from apps/desktop/src/store/session-pin-sync.ts, which carries three
 * rounds of race fixes; the only Universal-specific change is the write gate
 * (`ownsPersistedAppState`, so satellite/activity windows never author the
 * persisted pin set) in place of desktop's Electron-bridge check.

// The pull above can only speak for rows that are IN the payload. A session
// deleted elsewhere (a second app on this gateway, the CLI, or while this app
// was closed) is simply not in any page: nothing says `pinned: false`, so the
// pin survives, `$pinnedSessionCache` keeps serving its last-known row, and the
// Pinned section renders a chat that no longer exists — permanently, since both
// halves are persisted. It cannot even be opened.
//
// Absence alone is not the signal. The back-fill obeys the archived filter, so
// an archived-but-pinned chat is absent from a page too, and unpinning on that
// inference would quietly drop the pins of every archived conversation — worse
// than the ghost. `sessionExistsOnBackends` asks by id instead, which answers
// for archived rows and 404s only on real deletion.
//
// Three gates keep this cheap and safe:
//  - only after a SUCCESSFUL full refresh (`$sessionsListEpoch`), the one moment
//    a live pin cannot be missing from `$sessions`;
//  - only for pins that are actually RENDERING from the cache fallback, which is
//    the ghost by definition. A pin with no cached row shows nothing, and after
//    a gateway switch (which clears the cache) that is exactly every pin the
//    previous backend owned — so a switch can never spend probes on, or drop,
//    another gateway's pins;
//  - one verdict per id per cooldown, so the sidebar's frequent refreshes don't
//    re-probe an archived pin on every poll.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
