/**
 * The one `tauri://close-requested` handler this window gets, plus the satellite

 *
 * **Every branch calls `preventDefault`, and that is not defensive.** Tauri's
 * core calls `prevent_close()` for any window that has a JS close-requested
 * listener (`tauri/src/manager/window.rs`) and then emits the event; the JS
 * wrapper runs this handler and, if nothing prevented, calls `destroy()`. That
 * `destroy` is not in the ACL. So "return and let it close" is not a path that
 * closes anything — before this, a window that had ever opened a satellite could
 * not be closed by its titlebar button at all, because the second, re-entrant
 * pass found an empty set, stood aside, and hit the refused `destroy`. The old
 * `stands aside once there is nothing left to tear down` test asserted exactly
 * that dead end as the contract.
 *
 * The four outcomes, in order:
 *
 *  1. **Unanswered** — the preference has never been given, so the close is
 *     PARKED and the question goes on screen (`app/background-close-dialog.tsx`).
 *     The window is untouched until the answer comes back, and whichever answer
 *     it is finishes this close through the thunks handed over here.
 *  2. **Background mode** — this window is not going away, it is going out of
 *     sight. Its satellites outlive nothing (the window that summoned them is
 *     still here), so they stay, and the HUD stays summonable with no UI on
 *     screen. This is the branch that makes "close" mean "hide".
 *  3. **Satellites up** — a satellite may never outlive its summoner, so they go
 *     first and the window follows. No longer re-entrant: `closeThisWindow`
 *     destroys, so there is no second close request to service.
 *  4. **Nothing to do** — destroy.
 *
 * Installed at BOOT for any window that owns the app's persisted state, and
 * still lazily from `openSatelliteWindow` for the ones that do not (a tile
 * window can summon Quick Entry). Idempotent through `teardownInstalled`,
 * because there must be exactly one of these: JS is authoritative over the close,
 * and two handlers would race over what the close meant.
 *
 * The `SATELLITE_WINDOW_CLOSED_EVENT` listener is the other half of the
 * guarantee, and the one that is easy to miss: a satellite closed NATIVELY — the
 * compositor, the window manager, an OS close button — runs no JS teardown at
 * all, so `closeSatelliteWindow()` never happens for it. Without this, that close
 * leaks both halves of `forgetSatellite`: this window keeps claiming a satellite
 * that is gone, and — the part that outlives the process —
 * `hermes:surface-grant:<surface>` stays on disk, so the NEXT run's satellite can
 * read a grant negotiated for a window that died in a previous one. The event is
 * emitted from Rust (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `RunEvent::WindowEvent::Destroyed`)
 * precisely because it must arrive whether or not the dying page ran anything.
