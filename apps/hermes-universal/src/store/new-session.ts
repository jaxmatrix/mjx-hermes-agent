/**
 * "NEW SESSION", AS ONE ACT — the entry point behind ⌘N, ⌘T, the sidebar rail's
 * New session row, a chat strip's `+`, `/new`, and the sidebar's per-repo /
 * per-profile `+`.
 *
 * Creating a chat is three things, not one: the session exists, the surface
 * showing it is the focused one, and the caret is in its composer. Every entry
 * point used to do a different subset — ⌘T did none of the last two — so a new
 * session landed focused, half-focused or not at all depending on how you asked
 * for it (MJXHRM-6). They all funnel through here now, and the behaviour cannot
 * drift apart again.
 *
 * `newSession()` itself deliberately stays focus-free: session delete, archive,
 * profile switch, project-scope exit and the secondary window's re-home all call
 * it as a CONSEQUENCE of something else, and none of them may yank the caret.
 *
 * This module composes `session`, `session-states` and `chat-bubbles` rather
 * than living inside one of them — `chat-bubbles` already imports
 * `session-states`, so the mobile branch cannot live there without a cycle.
 * Nothing in `store/` imports this file; keep it that way. A store that needs a
 * new session wants `newSession()` / `newSessionTab()`, not the focus act.
