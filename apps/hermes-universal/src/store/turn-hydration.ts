/**
 * THE hydration seam: what happens to a turn when an authoritative transcript
 * arrives to replace the one we were streaming into.
 *
 * A cold open resolves REST history plus `session.resume` and then `rekeySession`s
 * the result onto the runtime id — overwriting whatever the placeholder slice
 * held. That is the exact moment three things must happen, in order:
 *
 *  1. RECONCILE the local tail against the authoritative transcript
 *     (`lib/live-tail.ts`) — the local slice is the only place the running
 *     turn's reasoning and tool calls exist, and the backend's snapshot is a
 *     flat pair of strings that cannot express them.
 *  2. RECOVER the crash journal (`lib/inflight-turn-journal.ts`) for the turn
 *     that never got an authoritative anything, because the app died mid-run.
 *  3. Keep JOURNALING, which every republish of `$sessionKeyStates` feeds.
 *
 * All three hang off store-layer seams rather than any one screen, and the
 * ordering is why they live in one module: reconciling after recovering would
 * fold the journal's rows in and then compare them against themselves.
