/**
 * FIND THE ROW FOR A STORED SESSION ID, wherever it happens to live.
 *
 * `$sessions` is the RECENTS PAGE — a paginated window, not the set of sessions
 * that exist. Every surface that renders a session by id resolved it with a
 * `$sessions.find(...)` and treated a miss as "unknown", so anything outside
 * that window lost its identity: a tab for an older session fell back to the
 * literal string `'Session'`, the main tab read `'New session'` for a chat that
 * was neither new nor unnamed, and both lost their accent colour — because the
 * colour resolver takes a `SessionInfo` and there was none to give it
 * (MJXHRM-386).
 *
 * Two more places hold real rows, and between them they cover the cases a tab
 * can actually be open for:
 *
 *  - `$pinnedSessionCache` — the last-known row for every pinned session,
 *    persisted precisely so the Pinned list survives pagination.
 *  - `$projectTree` — the backend's project → repo → lane tree, which carries
 *    the full `SessionInfo` for every session it lists, and is what the sidebar
 *    renders once a project is entered.
 *
 * It lives in its own module because `store/session` cannot import
 * `store/projects` (projects already imports session).
 *
 * `sessionRowFor` itself is a PLAIN LOOKUP that subscribes to nothing — most of
 * its callers read a title during a pane-mirror sync, not during a render, and
 * hand `SESSION_ROW_SOURCES` to their own listener list. `useSessionRow` is the
 * render-time face of the same thing, and it lives here rather than at the call
 * site so "what the lookup reads" and "what a component subscribes to" cannot
 * drift apart.

/**
 * THE ID A WIRE CALL FOR THIS CONVERSATION HAS TO CARRY.
 *
 * A surface holds the id it was OPENED with, and universal deliberately never
 * renames those: auto-compression rotates a conversation's stored id, and tiles,
 * mobile bubbles, layout pane ids and the persisted `hermes.*` blobs all keep
 * the pre-rotation one (see `sessionAliasIds` in store/session). Row LOOKUP has
 * always followed that — `sessionRowFor` matches the live tip OR the lineage
 * root — so a tab titled from an old id shows the right name.
 *
 * Its VERBS are a different question, and the backend does not answer it
 * uniformly. Pin, archive, delete and the transcript read all resolve the whole
 * compression chain, so any alias works. `set_session_title`
 * (`PATCH /api/sessions/{id}`) and `update_session_cwd` (`session.workspace.move`)
 * write ONE row — while `list_sessions_rich` projects a chain onto its live tip
 * and surfaces the TIP's `title` and `cwd`. Renaming or re-homing under the
 * lineage root therefore wrote to a hidden ancestor: the toast said "Renamed",
 * the row never changed, and the next refresh put the old name straight back
 * (MJXHRM-423).
 *
 * So: layout keys stay whatever the surface holds, and everything that leaves
 * for the backend goes through here first. The sidebar row and the chat title
 * bar already did this by hand — they pass `session.id` off the row they
 * resolved — and `branchStoredSession` does it for `parent_session_id`. This is
 * that rule with one name, reachable from the surfaces that hold an alias.
 *
 * Falls back to the id as given when no source has seen the session: there is
 * nothing better to send, and the backend's own 404 is the right answer then.
