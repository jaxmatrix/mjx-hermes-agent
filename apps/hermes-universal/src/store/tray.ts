// The tray's copy — pushed down, because a native menu cannot read the catalog.
//
// `src-tauri/src/tray.rs` builds the menu with English literals so first paint is
// never blank, and everything after that comes from here. This is the split the
// app already uses wherever the webview owns the words and Rust owns the native
// lever (`appearance.rs` translucency, `keep_awake.rs`): there is no message
// bundle on the Rust side, five locales live in `src/i18n/*.ts`, and nothing over
// there re-renders when `display.language` changes.
//
// Kept OUT of `store/background-mode.ts` on purpose. That module is imported by
// `store/windows.ts`, and this one imports `store/connection`, which reaches a
// large part of the gateway graph — routing the tray push through the store the
// close guard depends on is how an import cycle gets built by accident.

 * string literals, property names and computed tails, so a key assembled from a
 * template is only "reached" if its LAST segment happens to appear somewhere
 * else in the tree. `tray.status.idle` would have been reachable by accident and
 * `tray.status.probing` not at all, and R1 deletes what it believes is dead.
