/**
 * The SessionTileDelegate implementation — the wiring layer that owns the
 * gateway + per-session cache, so tile UI stays dependency-light. Self-registers
 * at import (call site: app/contrib/controller.tsx). Universal has no desktop
 * `use-session-tile-delegate` hook / `use-prompt-actions` engine, so this is an
 * adapter over universal's primitives (`requestGateway`, the REST transcript,
 * `$sessionStates`).
 *
 * SCOPE: resume / submit / interrupt / the session verbs (archive, branch,
 * delete). Primary chat keeps its own path.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here, and no longer pending: edit, reload, restore and steer
 * in a tile. A `FIXME(MJX-50/tile-rewind)` stood here calling those a "full
 * rewind adapter" still to be built — they are all built, and none of them
 * needed an adapter, because the primitives take the SESSION KEY the surface
 * owns instead of resolving "whichever chat is active":
 *
 *  - edit    — `app/chat/runtime.tsx` `onEdit` → `submitEditedPrompt(id, text, key)`,
 *              `key = view.$runtimeId.get()`;
 *  - restore — `components/assistant-ui/thread/thread.tsx` → `restoreToMessage(id, target, key)`,
 *              which REFUSES rather than defaulting when the surface has no key;
 *  - steer   — `app/chat/chat-composer.tsx` → `redirectPrompt(text, view.$runtimeId.get() ?? …)`;
 *  - reload  — `app/chat/session-tile.tsx` `onReload` → `reloadTreePane(paneId)`,
 *              a layout verb, so it never belonged to a session delegate at all.
 *
 * Adding any of them here would be a second way to reach the same RPC. The list
 * is recorded so the absence reads as settled rather than unfinished.
 *
 * (`MJX-50` was a Linear id. That tracker is retired and its numbers did not
 * carry over, so the reference pointed at nothing by the time it was read.)
