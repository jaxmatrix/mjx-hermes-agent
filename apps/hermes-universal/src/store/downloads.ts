// The downloads spine: every gateway file or folder that is being written to
// this device, wherever in the app it was asked for.
//
// Four things shape it.
//
//  * **Rule 2.** The workspace lives on the GATEWAY, and the webview cannot
//    reach the network (`connect-src 'self' ipc:`). Every byte moves in Rust;
//    this module only ever asks and listens.
//  * **Rule 23.** Progress arrives on a per-instance topic,
//    `hermes-download://{id}/progress`, and the listener is registered BEFORE
//    the command is invoked — a download of a small file can finish inside the
//    round trip that registers the listener, and a bar that never moved is
//    indistinguishable from one that never started.
//  * **Rule 21.** Every window is its own WebView with its own copy of this
//    module. A download started from the HUD or a detached tile has to appear
//    in the main window's tray, so the owner rebroadcasts its rows over
//    `lib/webview-broadcast.ts` and peers fold them through the SAME reducer.
//  * **The queue.** Downloads run at most `MAX_CONCURRENT` at a time, so a
//    directory dragged in wholesale cannot open a dozen simultaneous transfers
//    and starve the one the user is actually watching.
//
// Ownership is deliberately narrow. The window that calls `startDownload` runs
// the transfer, subscribes to its topic and is the only one that will ever
// invoke a start command for that id — a peer's tray can watch and cancel, and
// nothing else. Cancel is the one action that works from anywhere without a
// hand-off, because `DownloadState` is Rust MANAGED state and therefore lives
// once per PROCESS, not once per window: `cancel_download(id)` finds the flag
// whichever window asks.
