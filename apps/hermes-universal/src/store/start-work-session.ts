// Composer "branch off into a new worktree" hand-off, ported from desktop's
// contrib wiring effect. The composer owns the draft and creates the worktree
// (store/projects `startWorkInRepo`); this side is the session half: open a
// fresh chat anchored to the just-created tree, then put the task that kicked it
// off back into the composer.
//
// A module-level `listen` rather than a React effect (desktop's shape) because
// the hand-off must land regardless of which shell is mounted — and `listen`,
// unlike `subscribe`, doesn't replay the current value at import time. The token
// guard is belt-and-braces for a request that somehow re-emits unchanged.
