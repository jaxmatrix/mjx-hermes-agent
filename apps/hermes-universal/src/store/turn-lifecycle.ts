/**
 * THE in-flight turn model — "is a turn live on this session, and does it
 * survive a reconnect?".
 *
 * `store/event-router.ts` folds events into transcripts; `store/session-reducer`
 * knows a session is `busy`. Neither answers the questions four separate
 * features need: what did we submit, was it acknowledged, has the gateway seen
 * it, is it compacting, and — after the socket drops mid-turn — is the turn we
 * think is live the same turn the gateway is still running?
 *
 * Desktop answers those across `use-message-stream/`, `use-prompt-actions/` and
 * `lib/inflight-turn-journal.ts` (~9,600 lines with no 1:1 target here). This
 * module is the universal-shaped equivalent: one record per session key, folded
 * by the same event stream the transcript reducer sees, plus a PURE
 * reconciliation planner that decides what to do when the gateway's answer and
 * ours disagree.
 *
 * Two deliberate shapes:
 *
 *  1. The decisions are pure functions (`applyTurnEvent`, `planTurnReconciliation`)
 *     with the atom writes layered on top. Reconnect behaviour is the part that
 *     is impossible to exercise by hand, so it has to be the part that is
 *     trivial to unit-test.
 *  2. Consumers attach through `observeTurnLifecycle` rather than being imported
 *     here. Compaction (store/compaction.ts), the crash journal
 *     (lib/inflight-turn-journal.ts) and steering all need the same
 *     transitions, and none of them may become a static dependency of the
 *     gateway hot path.

 * already published `busy` from the resume payload. On a reconnect there is no
 * such write, and nothing else reliably supplies one: `invalidateRuntimeBindings`
 * clears every slice's `busy` on the same `open` edge, and the only thing that
 * puts it back is `session.active_list`, which an older gateway does not serve
 * and which trails a poll behind. So a reconciled turn could be live in
 * `$inflightTurns` while its tile rendered an idle composer with no stop button,
 * or — the worse direction — settled in the record while the tile span forever
 * on a spinner nothing would ever clear.
 *
 * Only the fields the turn owns are touched. `needsInput` is a blocking prompt's
 * to clear, and `messages` belong to `reconcileSessionTail`.
