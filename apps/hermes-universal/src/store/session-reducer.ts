/**
 * THE transcript reducer — one pure function that folds a gateway event into ONE

 *
 * There used to be two reducers — this one for tiles and a parallel copy inside
 * `store/chat.ts` writing global atoms for the visible chat. Keeping them in
 * sync was the source of MJX-132 (a background session's tokens reaching the
 * on-screen transcript) and of quieter divergences: tiles never applied the
 * authoritative `final_response`, never rendered MEDIA: tags, and asked the
 * GLOBAL `$busy` whether a late tool event belonged to a settled turn.
 *
 * Side effects (pet, TTS, notifications, sound, workspace nudges) are NOT here —
 * they live in `store/event-router.ts`, which decides which of them are scoped
 * to the session that produced the event and which follow the active one.

 * Adopt the gateway's `session.info` runtime snapshot into the slice.

 * This used to take `cwd` and drop everything else on the floor — while three
 * comments in `store/model.ts` promised the opposite ("a live session's own
 * session.info sync takes over", "session.info will confirm it"). Nothing
 * consumed it, so a session's model/provider/effort/fast were whatever the LAST
 * optimistic pick wrote, and a session that never had one (every tile, every
 * detached window, every `/model` run from another client) had them blank
 * forever.
 *
 * It matters most for a MID-TURN model pick. `config.set model` on a running
 * session cannot swap the agent in place, so the gateway stashes the pick in
 * `pending_model_switch` and applies it at the next turn start — and
 * `_session_info` deliberately reports that PENDING model (`display_model`) so
 * the end-of-turn settle paints the user's choice instead of blipping back to
 * the model still running (`tui_gateway/server.py`). A client that ignores the
 * event never sees the pick confirmed at all.
 *
 * Gating, per field:
 *  - `cwd`/`model`/`provider` are truthiness-gated: the gateway reports `''` for
 *    "not known yet" (a session whose agent is still building has no
 *    `agent.model`), and blanking a painted model on a heartbeat is worse than
 *    keeping a slightly stale one.
 *  - `reasoning_effort`/`service_tier`/`fast` adopt any value of the right type,
 *    because `''` and `false` are real states there ("provider default" and
 *    "not fast"). Desktop's `sessionInfoStatePatch` draws the line in the same
 *    place.
 *
 * Returns the SAME state object when nothing changed. `session.info` is emitted
 * on every turn boundary and on every config write, so an unconditional spread
 * would republish `$sessionStates` — and re-render every chat surface — for
 * events that carry no news.
