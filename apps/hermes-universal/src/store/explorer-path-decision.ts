/**
 * "The user picked a folder in the explorer" — the DECISION half, with no
 * webview, no socket and no atoms (rule 35).
 *
 * The explorer and the agent's working directory used to be two sources of
 * truth that disagreed: `$fileTreeRootOverride` re-rooted the VIEW and won
 * outright over `$effectiveCwd`, so pressing Home moved the tree while the
 * session kept working somewhere else — and, worse, a real cwd change arriving
 * afterwards could not show through the still-active override. The binding was
 * one-way by construction.
 *
 * The fix is that there is only ONE thing to change: the session's cwd. The
 * tree already follows it (`$focusedCwd` → `$effectiveCwd`), so the explorer
 * never sets a root of its own. Everything below is about deciding WHOSE cwd a
 * click means and whether it is safe to move it right now.
 *
 * Kept separate from `store/explorer-path` so this — the part with all the
 * branches — is testable as a plain function.
