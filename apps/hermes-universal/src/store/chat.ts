//
// A REJECTION is only half of "the gateway did not take this answer" (MJXHRM-418

//  - `sudo.respond` / `secret.respond` / `clarify.respond` are `allow_expired`

//    tool's own wait gave up returns `{"status": "expired"}` — HTTP-200 shaped,
//    delivered nowhere.
//  - `approval.respond` returns `{"resolved": N}` from
//    `tools/approval.resolve_gateway_approval`, the COUNT of parked agent threads
//    it unblocked. `N === 0` means the queue was already empty: the five-minute
//    approval timeout popped it (`_await_gateway_decision`'s `_drop_entry`), a
//    `/stop` released it, another surface answered it, or the recovery retry
//    landed on a gateway that no longer has the thread. The command was BLOCKED.
//
// Reporting either of those as a normal send is the same lie the swallowed
// rejection was, so the outcome comes back to the caller and the bars say so.
