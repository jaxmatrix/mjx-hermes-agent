/**
 * LIVE-SESSION REHYDRATION + the coalesced session-list refresh — the half of
 * MJXHRM-43 that PR #92 deferred to "SE-D scope".
 *
 * `store/live-sync.ts` turns the gateway's change broadcasts into ticks. This
 * module is the consumer that makes `sessions.changed` mean something: without
 * it the event was recognised, demuxed onto `$sessionsChangeTick`, and read by
 * exactly one surface (the sidebar's messaging list) — which is a smaller
 * version of the bug the ticket was filed about.
 *
 * Two jobs, both keyed off the same tick:
 *
 * 1. **Liveness rehydration** (`session.active_list`). Renderer-only busy /
 *    needs-input state is lost on a reconnect while the backend keeps the turns
 *    running, and events emitted while the socket was down are never replayed —
 *    `_broadcast_watched_changes` only re-fires on the NEXT change. The
 *    gateway's in-memory registry is the authoritative snapshot and does not
 *    resume, focus or otherwise mutate a chat. It is authoritative about
 *    ABSENCE too: a turn that ends while the socket is degraded drops out of
 *    `_sessions` without this client seeing the `running: false` edge, so the
 *    row spins forever and the busy→idle transition that paints the "your turn"
 *    dot never fires. Reaping runtimes that vanish between snapshots restores
 *    both.
 *
 * 2. **The stored list.** `sessions.changed` also means the LIST may have new
 *    rows — a cron run's session, an inbound messaging turn creating a thread.
 *    Universal never polled that list at all, so those rows simply did not
 *    appear until the user did something. The refresh is heavier than the
 *    snapshot and the broadcast is only floored to 2s server-side, so it trails
 *    on a gap instead of firing per tick. The same call is the ON-CONNECT
 *    reseed universal lacked: a soft gateway switch refreshes the lists itself,
 *    but an AUTO-reconnect (sleep/wake, a blip, an expired ticket) went through
 *    nothing, and the broadcasts missed while the socket was down are never
 *    replayed.
 *
 * Ported from desktop's `app/contrib/hooks/use-background-sync.ts`, but as a
 * STORE rather than a React hook, and with three deliberate divergences the
 * universal architecture forces:
 *
 * - **Slices are keyed by session KEY, not by runtime id** (see
 *   `store/session-state-types.ts`). A conversation already open under a
 *   `hydrating:` / `draft:` placeholder must not get a second slice from the
 *   snapshot, so every row resolves through `runtimeKeyForStoredSession` first.
 * - **No slice is ever CREATED here.** Desktop creates one per snapshot row;
 *   universal records a stranger's liveness in `store/live-session-registry.ts`
 *   instead. A slice minted from the snapshot alone has no transcript and no
 *   transport, yet is indexed by stored id — so it satisfied the warm
 *   short-circuit in `openSession` / the tile delegate's `resumeSessionToState`
 *   and made them adopt an empty, unbound session INSTEAD of hydrating it
 *   through the `hydrating: → runtime` rekey (MJXHRM-356). See the registry's
 *   header for the whole shape.
 * - **The reap is identity-guarded.** Desktop can look a vanished runtime up
 *   directly because its keys ARE runtime ids; here the lookup goes through the
 *   stored id, so it must confirm the slice it lands on is the same runtime
 *   before clearing someone else's live turn.
