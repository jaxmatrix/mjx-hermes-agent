/**
 * ONE resolver for "the runtime session id I hold is dead."
 *
 * The gateway hands out a RUNTIME session id when a session resumes, and drops
 * it whenever its in-memory runtime goes away — sleep/wake, a backend restart, a
 * long idle. The stored session survives; the id we are holding does not. Every
 * session-scoped RPC hits this, not just `prompt.submit`: attach, `/compress`,
 * checkpoint restore and interrupt all run against the same id, and each one
 * that recovered on its own recovered slightly differently. Upstream consolidated
 * the whole bug class into a single wrapper (`fab99e828a`) and this is its shape.
 *
 * Two things make it correct rather than merely retrying:
 *
 *  - The resume goes out on the session's OWNING PROFILE. A resume without one
 *    lands on whichever gateway happens to be live and forks the conversation
 *    into the wrong profile's database. The probe stays gated on
 *    `sessionProfileIsAmbiguous()`, exactly as `openSession` does — see the note
 *    on `resumeStoredRuntimeSession`.
 *  - The retry is bounded to ONE attempt, and a caller may veto it after the
 *    resume lands (`driftReason`): the resume is the slow await, and the user can
 *    switch profile or chat during it. Landing the retry then would run the call
 *    against a session they are no longer looking at.
