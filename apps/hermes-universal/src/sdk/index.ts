/**
 * @hermes/plugin-sdk — THE plugin language. The vscode-module model: plugin
 * authors import exactly one module and get everything — they never touch
 * `@/…` internals and never need codebase access.
 *
 * Two delivery modes, one surface:
 *  - bundled (`src/plugins/<name>/`): the import resolves here via alias;
 *  - runtime-loaded (disk / gateway): the loader injects this same object as
 *    `globalThis.__HERMES_PLUGIN_SDK__` and rewrites the import to a shim that
 *    re-exports it, so a published plugin builds against the types with the SDK
 *    marked external.
 *
 * Capability tiers (WoW-style):
 *  - `host.state.*` — READONLY app state (nanostore atoms; `.get()` or
 *    subscribe; `useValue` in React).
 *  - `host.*` actions — curated, safe verbs (toast, haptic).
 *  - `host.request` — the gateway JSON-RPC door; the plugin's real power,
 *    and the future seam for per-plugin capability grants.
 *  - `ui.*` — the design language, so plugin UI looks native by default.
 *
 * ── Divergences from the desktop SDK (a plugin targeting both should know) ────
 *  - No `TitlebarTool`. Universal's titlebar is composed of TitlebarButton JSX,
 *    not descriptors, so `titleBar.left/center/right` are plain Slots — use a
 *    `render()` contribution. Same mechanism reaches the mobile top bar.
 *  - `ctx.rest` CAN upload and `ctx.socket` authenticates on every gateway mode
 *    — both are wider here than the note that used to sit in this spot claimed.
 *    `upload` is ONE file under the field name `file` (what a FastAPI
 *    `UploadFile` parameter expects): no multi-file, no extra form fields, no
 *    progress, and the whole file is held in memory. Desktop takes the same
 *    shape but refuses an upload outright against an OAuth-gated backend.
 *  - `ctx.os` has the same four members and the same result contract, but sits
 *    over Tauri instead of the Electron preload bridge — so on mobile (and in a
 *    plain-browser dev run) more of them resolve `false` than on the desktop
 *    app. Branch on the result; never assume the door opened.
