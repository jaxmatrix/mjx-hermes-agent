/**
 * The HUD stylesheet's DOM contract (MJXHRM-438).
 *
 * **This is the test whose absence caused the bug it now guards.** The HUD's
 * entire visual identity — collapse at rest, the glance, the reveal on focus —
 * was three `html[data-hud]` rules scoped to `[data-slot='composer-bounds']`, an
 * element only `apps/desktop` has ever rendered. They matched nothing, in a
 * window nobody's tests opened, for the life of the feature. `--hud-band-max`
 * was computed in React and read by no rule; `data-hud-engaged` drove nothing.
 * Everything typechecked, every suite was green, and the shipped HUD was a
 * miniature chat window.
 *
 * A stylesheet selector is a contract between two files that never import each
 * other, so nothing in the toolchain can notice when one end moves. This closes
 * it: every `data-*` attribute, every attribute VALUE and every class the HUD
 * block selects on has to be rendered by something in `src/`, or this fails with
 * the offending selector's own text.
 *
 * Scoped to `html[data-hud]` deliberately. That is the block with no other
 * reader — every other rule in this stylesheet is exercised by the main window
 * every time anyone looks at it, while a HUD only opens on a chord, over other
 * applications, on a developer's real machine.
 *
 * Two traps this went through while being written, both worth keeping in mind
 * before "simplifying" the scan:
 *
 *  1. **A mention is not a render.** `store/composer-popout.ts` both documents
 *     and `querySelector`s `[data-slot="composer-bounds"]` — while saying in the
 *     same comment that this app has no such element. A scan that accepted a
 *     quoted string anywhere reported the dead selector as live, i.e. came back
 *     green over the very defect it exists to find.
 *  2. **A render is not always a literal.** The composer's own input is
 *     `data-slot={RICH_INPUT_SLOT}`, and that constant is declared in a
 *     different file. A scan that only accepted `data-slot="…"` reported a live
 *     element as dead — and MJXHRM-433 is explicit that a false orphan is the
 *     expensive direction of this error.
 *
 * So the scan collects RENDER SITES (a JSX prop or a `dataset` write) and
 * resolves single-identifier values through module constants.
