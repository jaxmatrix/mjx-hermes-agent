/**
 * Shiki's THEME CONSTANTS.
 *
 * They live alone because a caller should not have to import a highlighter
 * component to get them — that import is what kept dragging the engine back
 * into the entry chunk (MJXHRM-380). Values only: this module must never import
 * `shiki`, or it stops being cheap to reach.
 *
 * `diff-lines.tsx` is the last reader. The chat fence (the iOS one-line collapse) and the file
 * preview's source view (the empty source pane) render their own tokens instead, painted with
 * the `--code-*` custom properties in styles.css — seeded from these same two
 * themes so the surfaces still match.
