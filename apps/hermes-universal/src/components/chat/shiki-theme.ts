/**
 * Shiki's THEME CONSTANTS.
 *
 * They live alone because `diff-lines.tsx` and the preview pane both need them
 * and neither should have to import a highlighter component to get them — that
 * import is what kept dragging the engine back into the entry chunk
 * (MJXHRM-380). Values only: this module must never import `shiki` or
 * `react-shiki`, or it stops being cheap to reach.
 *
 * The chat fence no longer reads these. It renders through `CodeFence`, which
 * computes its own tokens and paints them with the `--code-*` custom properties
 * in styles.css — seeded from these same two themes so the panes still match.
