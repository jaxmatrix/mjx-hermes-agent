/**
 * The layout renderer's telemetry SEAM — two null hooks, and no imports.
 *
 * The renderer is app code that ships; the instruments that read it
 * (`observability/auto/engine-probe.ts`, `observability/auto/layout-counters.ts`)
 * are dev/bench only. Importing them from here would drag the whole
 * observability layer into the release bundle to answer questions nobody there
 * can ask, and importing the tracer into the render path is also how you end up
 * with a cycle between the layout engine and the thing measuring it.
 *
 * So the renderer calls hooks that are null until something installs them. Cost
 * in release: one call to a function that returns immediately, per split render
 * and per layout commit. The same shape the engine already uses for
 * `registerPaneCloser` and the side openers.
