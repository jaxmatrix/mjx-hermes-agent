          MINIMIZE HIDES, IT DOES NOT UNMOUNT (MJXHRM-373). This used to be
          `{!node.minimized && …}`, which tore down every tile in the zone —
          not just the active one, the whole kept set. For a chat that lost the
          transcript's scroll position; for a terminal on the LOCAL transport it
          killed the shell, because `TerminalView`'s unmount cleanup invokes
          `pty_kill`. The zone renderer was making a process-lifetime decision
          on the terminal's behalf.

          Frozen at its last size and taken OUT OF FLOW rather than
          `display: none`d, for two reasons. A zero-height box would make xterm
          refit to one row and REFLOW the scrollback — destroying the thing the
          fix is meant to preserve. And `display: none` destroys the layout
          boxes, so every scroller inside snaps back to the top on restore.
          `visibility: hidden` at a fixed size keeps both, and keeps
          ResizeObserver quiet: nothing inside the zone resizes at all while it
          is folded away. */}
