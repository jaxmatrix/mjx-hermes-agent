 * ═══ THE IMPORT HANDSHAKE (MJXHRM-420) ═══
 *
 * `ownsPersistedAppState()` answers "may this window AUTHOR the layout?", and
 * for a tile window / a satellite / an Android activity screen the answer is no:
 * they share one origin's `localStorage` with the real window and hold no tree
 * of their own, so every commit they make — boot adoption, a default
 * declaration — would be someone else's layout being overwritten.
 *
 * There is exactly one write that is not theirs to withhold. A layout that
 * arrives inside an imported profile is authored by the ARCHIVE, not by the
 * window that unpacked it, and on Android the Profiles screen runs in an
 * activity window and is the only import door there. Gating that write on window
 * ownership dropped it silently: `applyTree` still cleared the user's pane size
 * overrides, still cleared their user-placed pins and still wrote the `custom`
 * preset marker (none of those go through `persist`), so the import degraded the
 * layout it then failed to replace, and the next launch read the old tree back.
 *
 * So the gate is on the OPERATION, not only on the window. `adoptImportedTree`
 * raises `adoptingImportedTree` for the duration of one adoption, and:
 *
 *  - `persist` writes through it, whatever window kind this is;
 *  - a monotonic token lands in `IMPORT_TOKEN_KEY`, which is what tells every
 *    OTHER live window that the tree on disk was authored elsewhere and is meant
 *    to replace the one it is holding. Without that, the main window keeps its
 *    in-memory tree and re-persists it on its very next commit, so the import
 *    would survive on disk for about as long as it takes to click a tab.
 *
 * The token is deliberately separate from the tree key. Two primary windows
 * (desktop `open_instance_window`) both own the layout and both write the tree
 * key, so "the tree key changed" cannot tell an ordinary commit next door from
 * an import — only the token bump can, and adopting on the token alone leaves
 * multi-instance behaviour exactly as it was.

 *
 *  1. PRESENCE  — is it in the tree at all?          `$dismissedPanes`
 *  2. REVEAL    — does its owning store say show it?  `$hiddenTreePanes`
 *  3. ENCLOSURE — can its CONTAINER show it?          `$collapsedTreeSides`
 *                                                     + `GroupNode.minimized`
 *                                                     + the narrow breakpoint
 *
 * Axes 1–2 are properties of the tile and resolve from an id — `tileVisibility`
 * in `tile/visibility.ts`. Axis 3 is a property of the container and needs the
 * tree — `zoneEnclosure` in `tile/enclosure.ts`. They are separate functions
 * for that reason, not by accident; both files say so at the top.
 *
 * The two that were never visibility:
 *  - `collapsePanes`, a module-level `Set` naming the tool panels. A TRAIT of
 *    the surface, written once at import — now `TileChrome.toolPanel`.
 *  - `$userPlacedPanes` (below), which answers "should auto-dock leave this
 *    alone?". Placement, not visibility; it is read in exactly one place.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * REVEAL. Panes hidden by app chrome toggles (titlebar sidebar / right-sidebar
 * buttons). The tree KEEPS the zone and its mounted content — the zone renderer
 * holds the body of a hidden pane that has been on screen at least once
 * (MJXHRM-373; before that it dropped it, so every toggle was a teardown and
 * rebuild); a zone whose every pane is hidden collapses to nothing until a
