// disclosure, a hoisted `todo` is nothing — while a diff, an image card or a
// wall of markdown really does build DOM and is charged for it.
//
// Pricing by part count instead had the budget counting work that never
// mounts: one tool-heavy turn is dozens of parts that paint as a handful of
// one-line summaries, so a session spent the whole page in two or three turns
// and offered "Show earlier" over a screen and a half of transcript.
//
// "Show earlier" prepends another page; whole turns stay intact so the sticky
// human bubble never loses its turn. This is the long-session perf lever
// WITHOUT a virtualizer — pure rendering, never touches scrollTop, so it can't
// fight use-stick-to-bottom (the single scroll owner). What the DOM can hold is

// message fibers, and every streaming flush pays selector re-runs and React
// commit traversal over ALL of them. Sharing the budget keeps "screens of
// scrollback" constant instead of "turns per pane": a pane a quarter the height
// gets a quarter the page, floored at a quarter budget (MIN_VISIBLE_GROUPS
// still floors the turn count regardless of weight). Panes that already
// backfilled keep their mounted content when the count changes — the share only
// caps where NEW backfills stop.
//
// VISIBLE panes, not mounted ones (desktop counts mounts). Keep-alive leaves

/**
 * The ceiling on one consolidation, and the stall that ends it early.
 *
 * CONSOLIDATE, THEN REVEAL — the point of the gate below. Opening a long chat
 * used to show the transcript assembling itself: the backfill grows the mounted
 * tree in ~8 steps and each step lays out and PAINTS, so the user watched eight
 * versions of their chat arrive, each shifting under the last. A trace of one
 * open counted eight `layout.forced` commits of 44–184ms, every one
 * `styleMs: 0` — pure layout — spread over 2.5 seconds, with a dozen image
 * resolves landing in the middle of it.
 *
 * None of that work goes away by hiding it. What goes away is the user watching
 * it happen, which is the actual complaint: a placeholder for a moment reads as
 * loading, while a transcript that reflows eight times reads as broken.
 *
 * WHY TWO NUMBERS AND NOT ONE DEADLINE. The first version capped the whole
 * consolidation at 900ms, and a capture said what is wrong with that: a
 * code-heavy chat with a dozen images reported `deadline: 1`, `grewPx: 8822`,
 * and a render budget still at 380 of 600 — revealed 40% assembled, with 545ms
 * of forced layout still to come. The flicker moved rather than went away.
 *
 * The mistake was measuring the wrong thing. Elapsed time says nothing about
 * whether a transcript is arriving: a chat that needs 2s of honest work and one
 * whose media fetch has hung look identical at t+900ms. PROGRESS distinguishes
 * them — height changing, rows mounting, groups arriving. So:
 *
 *   STALL   nothing has changed for this long → whatever we are waiting for is
 *           not coming. Reveal.
 *   CAP     an absolute ceiling, so a transcript that genuinely never stops
 *           growing (a live stream resumed into view) cannot hold the
 *           placeholder indefinitely.
 *
 * Both are escape hatches, not the normal path: `chat.consolidate`'s `deadline`
 * attribute marks the captures where one fired, which is what makes "these
 * numbers are wrong" a measurement rather than a hunch.
