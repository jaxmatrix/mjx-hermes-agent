 * The token → DOM layer, shared by every code surface this app owns.

 * It used to live inside `components/chat/code-fence.tsx`. It is here so the
 * file preview can render the SAME elements instead of growing a second
 * implementation — the fence's structure is the one the fence rebuild proved out, and the
 * point of sharing it is that there is nothing left to diverge. `CodeFence`
 * itself is unchanged apart from importing this instead of declaring it.
 *
 * The structural rules from the fence's header comment apply to every caller:
 * WE render the elements, nothing third-party sits between the `<pre>` and the
 * text, and anything whose absence would make the block unreadable or
 * geometrically wrong is an INLINE STYLE rather than a class.

/**
 * Custom properties rather than literal hex, so a theme flip repaints with no
 * JS and no re-tokenizing. The `currentColor` fallback is the point: if a
 * property is ever missing the declaration still resolves, and the token renders
 * in the surrounding text colour instead of disappearing.
 *
 * `plain` has no entry on purpose — a plain token renders as a bare text node,
 * exactly as in the un-tokenized path, which is both fewer DOM nodes and one
 * less way for the two paths to differ.
