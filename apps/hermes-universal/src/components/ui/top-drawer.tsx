/**
 * A menu presented as a drawer down from the top, for touch.
 *
 * WHY A DRAWER AND NOT THE DROPDOWN. A dropdown is anchored to its trigger and
 * sized to its content, which is fine beside a mouse and wrong under a thumb:
 * on a phone it opens off the edge, its rows are sized by their text, and a
 * submenu is reached by HOVER, which a finger does not have. A drawer is
 * full-width, its rows are real touch targets, and a submenu becomes a PAGE.
 *
 * PAGES ARE THE CALLER'S. This owns the surface — the panel, the header, the
 * close — and takes `onBack` when the caller has pushed a page, because only
 * the caller knows what a submenu means. That keeps one drawer serving both a
 * flat nav list and a menu with interactive submenus.
