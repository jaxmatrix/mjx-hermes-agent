/**
 * Span recording — the core of the observability layer.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR
 *
 * A span records when an operation started, when it ended, and what it was
 * nested inside. One interaction therefore becomes a waterfall rather than a
 * bag of durations, and the quantity that falls out of the waterfall is the one
 * worth having: `gapMs`, the time inside a span that NO child accounts for.
 *
 * That number is why this exists instead of a histogram. Chasing a slow pane
 * drag, every individual measurement looked healthy — React commits summed to
 * 768ms of 5167ms, forced style+layout to 14ms, the drag callback to 6ms — and
 * the aggregate could not express the only interesting fact, which was "and
 * then nothing we measure happened for 200ms". A gap is not a stage; it is the
 * ABSENCE of one, and no histogram has a bucket for it. Spans do.
 *
 * ONE CAPTURE, ONE TRACE
 *
 * Everything recorded between `setRecording(true)` and `setRecording(false)`
 * belongs to a single trace, hung off a single `capture` root span.
 *
 * The first version instead made every span with an empty stack a ROOT, and
 * minted a trace id per root. That reads as reasonable and is catastrophic in
 * practice, because *every* seam in this app is entered from a fresh task —
 * a PerformanceObserver callback, a Tauri event listener, a React render, an
 * await continuation — at which point the stack is always empty. So every span
 * was a root: one session produced 573 traces, essentially all of them a single
 * span, and nothing nested inside anything. `gapMs` had nothing to subtract
 * from and Jaeger had nothing to draw.
 *
 * Hence `currentParent()`: the synchronous stack when there is one, and the
 * capture root otherwise. A span with no discoverable parent is not evidence
 * that a new trace started — it is evidence that the work was scheduled, which
 * is the normal case in a browser.
 *
 * IDENTITY IS A SERIAL, NOT A BUFFER INDEX
 *
 * Spans are addressed by a monotonic serial that no drain resets, and a parent
 * is stored as its parent's SERIAL. That is what lets a trace outlive a flush:
 * the exporter ships completed spans every couple of seconds and compacts the
 * buffer, and a child recorded three drains after its parent still points at
 * the right span. With indices it could not — `clearSpans` recycles them, so a
 * long operation (an SSH connect runs 45–90s, roughly 45 drains) would graft
 * its later spans onto whatever unrelated span had inherited the index.
 *
 * COST WHEN OFF
 *
 * Recording is off by default and this module ships in release builds, so
 * "off" has to be genuinely free: every entry point early-returns on one
 * boolean. That is the whole prod cost — no allocation, no timestamp, no work.
 * Enabling it is an explicit act (the dev HUD, or `__hermesTrace.on()`), which
 * is what makes it safe to have a user turn on while reproducing a bug and hand
 * back the result.
 *
 * CLOCK CAVEAT
 *
 * WebKitGTK clamps `performance.now()` to 1ms, so spans shorter than that
 * report 0 and boundaries land on tick edges. At frame scale (16ms+) that is
 * immaterial — which is the scale this is for. Do not read a sub-millisecond
 * span duration as anything but noise.
 */

/**
 * Spans held between drains.
 *
 * This used to have to cover a whole capture, because a drain destroyed the
 * buffer's parent relationships and so could only happen between interactions.
 * It now only has to cover one drain interval (2s) plus whatever is still open,
 * so the same number is comfortable rather than tight.
 *
 * Overflow still DROPS rather than wraps — see `beginSpan`.
