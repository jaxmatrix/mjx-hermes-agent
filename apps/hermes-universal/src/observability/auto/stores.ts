/**
 * nanostores autocapture — every store write becomes a span, with no per-store
 * code and no way to forget a new one.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AUTOMATIC RATHER THAN HAND-PLACED
 *
 * This module exists because of a specific, expensive mistake. Chasing a janky
 * sidebar drag, a span was placed by hand on `$layoutTree` — the obvious
 * suspect — and it recorded *nothing*, because an edge sidebar is a fixed track
 * and writes `$paneStates` instead. The capture came back clean and empty, with
 * no hint that the instrument was pointed at the wrong object, and it cost a
 * full measure-and-report round to notice. A hand-placed span encodes a guess
 * about where the time goes; being wrong about the location is silent. Wrapping
 * the constructor makes being wrong cost nothing.
 *
 * HOW IT IS INSTALLED
 *
 * vite.config.ts aliases `nanostores` to this module, so all ~140 call sites are
 * covered — including the ~34 files that import the package directly rather than
 * through the `@/store/atom` seam. It re-exports the real package's entire
 * surface and replaces only `atom`, `map` and `computed`.
 *
 * DEV/BENCH ONLY. A store write is a hot path — one per stream token — and
 * wrapping it in release to record nothing is a cost with no matching benefit.
 * The signals worth having from a real user are interaction latency and the
 * semantic spans, not this.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THAT WOULD BREAK IT SILENTLY
 *
 * 1. Returning a *different* nanostores instance. `resolve.dedupe` covers only
 *    react/react-dom; two nanostores copies would leave `useStore` subscribed to
 *    stores nobody writes to, and the UI would simply stop updating. Hence the
 *    `export *` — same objects, same identities, one instance.
 * 2. Recording every write. `$petActivity` is written on every reasoning token
 *    and `$voiceConversation` on every audio frame; without a floor the buffer
 *    fills in seconds and the trace is chatter. See NOISE_FLOOR_MS.

/**
 * Only writes at least this expensive become spans.
 *
 * The point of store spans is to catch a write whose synchronous fan-out is
 * expensive — nanostores notifies listeners inline, so an `atom.set` that
 * triggers a cascade shows its cost right here. A write that costs nothing is
 * not evidence of anything, and there are a lot of them: `$sessionKeyStates` at
 * ~30Hz while streaming, `$layoutTree` and `$dropHint` once per frame while
 * dragging, `$petActivity` per reasoning token, `$voiceConversation` per audio
 * frame. Recording those would exhaust the span buffer before the interesting
 * write ever happened.
 *
 * 1ms rather than 0 also matches the clock: WebKitGTK clamps performance.now()
 * to 1ms, so anything below this is indistinguishable from zero anyway.
