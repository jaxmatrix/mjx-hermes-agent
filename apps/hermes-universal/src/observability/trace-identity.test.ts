/**
 * Regression tests for trace IDENTITY.
 *
 * Two bugs live here, and they are opposites.
 *
 * The first: trace ids derived from the root span's buffer INDEX. The exporter
 * recycles indices on every drain, so root index 0 in one flush window and root
 * index 0 in the next produced the SAME id, silently merging unrelated work.
 *
 * The second, and much worse: a span whose synchronous stack was empty became a
 * ROOT, and every root minted a new trace. Every seam in this app is entered
 * from a scheduled callback — a PerformanceObserver, a Tauri listener, a React
 * render, an await continuation — so in practice EVERY span was a root. One
 * session produced 573 traces of one span each. Nothing nested, and `gapMs` had
 * nothing to subtract from.
 *
 * The fix for both is the same shape: identity comes from the capture, and
 * parentage falls back to the capture root rather than to nothing.
