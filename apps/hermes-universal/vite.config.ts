  //   • `mermaid` is genuinely lazy-only (`embeds/registry.tsx`) and does land in
  //     its own chunk;
  //   • `@codemirror/*` is split into a chunk, but the ENTRY statically imports
  //     that chunk (profiles / starmap / profile-switcher / preview-file all
  //     import `CodeEditor` eagerly), so it is split without being deferred;
  //   • `@xterm/*` and `katex` have no lazy boundary anywhere and are inlined
  //     straight into `index-*.js`.
  // Desktop imports all three the same way, so this is parity, not a port gap —
  // but pre-bundling them still costs nothing and keeps dev-server behaviour
  // stable, so the entries stay. Deps reached statically from the entry (the
  // assistant-ui stack) are deliberately absent: the scanner already finds those
  // on cold start.
  //
  // `shiki` and `react-shiki` MOVED into this list in MJXHRM-380, which put a
  // `lazy()` / dynamic `import()` in front of all four of OUR entry points to
  // them — exactly the shape the reload hazard above describes: without these
  // entries the first code fence in a conversation would re-run the optimiser and
  // reload the page mid-reply.
  //
  // `react-shiki` left this list with the dependency. `shiki` stays:
  // three of those four seams are gone (the fence and the preview compute their
  // own colours), but `import('shiki')` in diff-lines.tsx is still there and
  // still first hit mid-conversation, which is the whole hazard.
  //
  // MJXHRM-45 then found the seam was still defeated by a fifth importer we do
  // not own — `@streamdown/code` statically imports shiki, and
  // `markdown-text.tsx` statically imported that — and deferred it to first
  // markdown mount. MJXHRM-380's follow-up removed that dependency outright
  // instead: supplying `components.SyntaxHighlighter` makes assistant-ui replace
  // streamdown's own code block, and `plugins.code` feeds nothing else, so the
  // plugin was downloading all of shiki (plus a second regex engine) for a dead
  // branch. See the comment above `MARKDOWN_PLUGINS` in markdown-text.tsx.
  //
