 * `@` alias, the React-singleton pins, Tailwind v4, the `__TRACE_RUN_DEFAULT__`
 * define, the deliberate empty-PostCSS guard and the `/emojibase` dev middleware

/**
 * Storybook-only module substitutions.
 *
 * `@/lib/platform` makes the device flags switchable, which is what lets the
 * mobile story render the mobile composer rather than the desktop one wearing a
 * class. The rest stub the Tauri boundary at its entry points — `api/core` alone
 * has 36 importers — instead of stubbing the ~15 `@/store/*` and `@/lib/*`
 * modules stacked on top of them.
 *
 * `@tauri-apps/api-real/core` is not redundant next to `@tauri-apps/api/core`:
 * below `NODE_ENV=production` the app's config already points the public
 * specifier at its IPC-tracing wrapper, and that wrapper reaches the real module
 * through the `-real` escape hatch. Storybook dev is exactly that case, so
 * stubbing only the public name would leave the hatch open.
