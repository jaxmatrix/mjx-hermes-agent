/**
 * Android side of tauri-plugin-mic.
 *
 * There is no custom logic here: Tauri's base [Plugin] class already implements
 * `checkPermissions` / `requestPermissions` driven entirely by the
 * `@TauriPlugin(permissions = [...])` annotation below. Declaring RECORD_AUDIO as
 * the `microphone` alias is all that's needed for `getPermissionStates()` and the
 * runtime request dialog to cover the mic.
 *
 * MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS is intentionally NOT listed here — it is an install-time
 * permission with no runtime dialog, so it only needs the manifest declaration
 * (see AndroidManifest.xml).
