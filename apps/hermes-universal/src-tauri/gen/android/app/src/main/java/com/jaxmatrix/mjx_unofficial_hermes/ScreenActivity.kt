// Native screen activity (MJX-141). Hosts every windowable surface — Settings,
// Command Center, Profiles — in ONE Activity; the surface is chosen by the route
// the WebView loads (`?win=activity#<route>`) and can change in place. Launched
// from Rust `open_screen_window` (label "screen", activity_name "ScreenActivity").
//
// Unlike MainActivity — where TauriActivity's `handleBackNavigation = false` means
// hardware back exits the app — back here walks the in-WebView history and, at the
// root, finishes the activity, returning to MainActivity (the sessions screen). The
// web Home button finishes it explicitly via the `__hermesActivity` bridge (Tauri's
// window.close() does not finish an Android Activity — see HomeBridge).
//
// That handler is installed HERE rather than taken from WryActivity (which is why
// `handleBackNavigation` stays false below), because WryActivity's version — plain
// `canGoBack()` / `goBack()` — is wrong for this Activity once a sign-in has run.
//
// Android cannot open a second webview window, so a gateway or Hermes Cloud sign-in
// started from Settings navigates THIS WebView to the provider's login page and then
// back to the app (`src-tauri/src/oauth.rs`, `src-tauri/src/cloud.rs`). Both legs go
// through `loadUrl`, so both PUSH history: after one sign-in the back-forward list
// reads `[app #/settings] [gateway /auth/login] [IDP …] [gateway dashboard] [app
// #/settings]`. `goBack()` from the Settings screen the user lands back on therefore
// walks them BACKWARDS into the gateway's own web dashboard, rendered full-bleed
// inside the Settings activity with no app chrome — and every further back press
// goes one redirect deeper into the login cascade instead of out of it.
//
// So the rule is: go back only while the previous entry shares an origin with the
// current one, and finish the Activity at any origin boundary. In-app hash routes
// all share the app origin and still walk normally; the login cascade is walkable
// while you are inside it; and crossing out of the app — or back into a login that
// has already completed — leaves the screen instead, which is what back means here.
