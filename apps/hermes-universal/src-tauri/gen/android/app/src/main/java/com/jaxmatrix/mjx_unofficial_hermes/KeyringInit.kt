/**
 * Hand the Android Context to the native credential store, once per process.
 *
 * `android-native-keyring-store` reads its Context and JavaVM out of the global
 * `ndk_context` crate. Tauri and wry do NOT populate it — nothing else in the
 * tree depends on `ndk_context` — so without this the first Keystore call reads
 * an uninitialized context and aborts the process rather than returning an error.
 *
 * Called from every activity's `onCreate`, after `super`, so the native library
 * is loaded and it does not matter which activity the user arrives through. The
 * Rust side creates the store lazily on first use (`secrets::store::ensure`), by
 * which point this has run.
