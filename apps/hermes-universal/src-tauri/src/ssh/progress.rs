//! Connect-progress reporting.
//!
//! New work. The Electron desktop app emitted nothing during a connect, and got
//! away with it: on a laptop the whole sequence is quick and the window is
//! already full of UI. Ours can take 45–90 seconds on a first connect — platform
//! probe, `hermes` discovery, capability check, token upload, spawn, then
//! waiting for the backend to bind — and a phone showing a motionless spinner
//! for that long is indistinguishable from a hang.
//!
//! Events follow `transport.rs`'s `ws://{id}/…` convention, including its
//! contract: the caller generates the id and subscribes **before** invoking, so
//! no step is missed.
