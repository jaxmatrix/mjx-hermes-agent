//! SSH gateway transport (MJX-55).
//!
//! Reaches a Hermes backend on a remote host over SSH. The shape, ported from the
//! Electron desktop app (`apps/desktop/electron/{ssh-connection,remote-lifecycle,
//! windows-remote-lifecycle}.ts`):
//!
//!   1. Dial the host as an SSH *client*. Nothing listens on port 22 here — 22 is
//!      the destination, and the gateway protocol is never piped over stdio.
//!   2. Run control-plane `exec` channels to probe the platform, locate `hermes`,
//!      check its capabilities, read/write a lockfile, and upload a session token
//!      over stdin (never argv).
//!   3. Spawn `hermes serve --isolated --host 127.0.0.1 --port 0` detached on the
//!      remote and scrape `HERMES_(BACKEND|DASHBOARD)_READY port=<N>` from its log.
//!      It binds remote loopback only — the tunnel is the sole route in.
//!   4. Forward a local `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>` TCP port to that remote port. The
//!      ordinary HTTP + `/api/ws` traffic then rides that forward, so the rest of
//!      the app just sees a token-authed backend on loopback.
//!   5. On reconnect, reuse the still-running remote backend via the lockfile plus
//!      an authenticated `GET /api/ssh/ownership` nonce proof. Teardown drops the
//!      tunnel, NOT the remote backend.
//!
//! Unlike `local_backend.rs`, nothing in this module is `#[cfg(desktop)]`-gated.
//! russh is pure Rust and cross-compiles to the mobile targets, which is the whole
//! reason we do not shell out to the system `ssh` binary — see the `russh`
//! dependency comment in Cargo.toml.
//!
//! The POSIX path (steps 1-5) is live. `windows_lifecycle` — the same lifecycle
//! against a remote host running Windows — is still pure-only and is wired next.

// windows_lifecycle has no caller until its dispatch lands, and a handful of
// accessors exist for it. Without this they read as dead code and the real
// warnings drown.
