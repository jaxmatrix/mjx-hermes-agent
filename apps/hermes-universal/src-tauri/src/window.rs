//! Native multi-window support: MJX-104 (desktop session/instance pop-outs),
//! MJX-142 (iOS UIScene), MJX-141 (Android Activity). Opens an internal app route
//! in a new `WebviewWindow`: a single chat session (frameless, `?win=secondary`),
//! a full app instance, or an activity screen (Settings / Command Center,
//! `?win=activity&screen=…`). Windows are built on the main thread (gtk/WKWebView
//! requirement), mirroring `oauth.rs`. Rust-side creation bypasses the ACL; each
//! new window's JS surface is scoped by the `session-*` / `instance-*` / `settings`
//! / `command-center` capability globs in `capabilities/default.json`.
//!
//! Platform model:
//! - Desktop: real multi-window. Session/instance pop-outs open frameless windows;
//!   activity screens stay in-app overlays (the stubs below only keep the command
//!   names registered).
//! - iOS (MJX-142/176): with `UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes` (`Info.ios.plist`)
//!   set, building a `WebviewWindow` maps onto a native `UIScene` — side-by-side on
//!   iPad, replacing on single-scene iPhone. Session/instance pop-outs and the
//!   Settings/Command-Center activity screens all open as scenes. `fill_requested_scene`
//!   fills scenes the *system* requests unprompted (state restoration, iPad
//!   app-switcher "+", Handoff) via `RunEvent::SceneRequested` in `lib.rs`.
//! - Android (MJX-141): Settings/Command Center open as their own `TauriActivity`
//!   (bound by label via `activity_name`). Session/instance pop-outs are not yet
//!   wired on Android (stubbed); the frontend gates that affordance off there.
//!
//! The runtime affordances are gated frontend-side on `supportsMultipleWindows()`
//! (`store/windows.ts`).

// Satellites (MJXHRM-55 / MJXHRM-213 / MJXHRM-382)
//
// A satellite is a SECOND SURFACE of the app in its own window — living over
// other applications, and gone the moment it is done. Three exist: the HUD and
// Quick Entry, both summoned by a hotkey and typed into, and the wake indicator
// (MJXHRM-228), which is not typed into at all — it is a light, opened and
// closed by the state it mirrors rather than by the user, and it is the only one
// that takes neither clicks nor focus.
//
// They are built HERE rather than in the frontend, and the frontend no longer
// holds `core:webview:allow-create-webview-window` at all. That is a security
// boundary, not tidiness (MJXHRM-382): a satellite is the one window kind that
// may be handed a wlr-layer-shell role — an output-sized overlay with exclusive
// keyboard focus — and while the webview could mint windows, the label space
// that role is keyed on was writable by whoever ran code in the webview. Any
// plugin (`contrib/runtime-loader.ts`: "a loaded plugin is evaluated as ESM in
// the webview realm with FULL app authority") could create its own `sat-…`,
// hand it that role, and cover the screen with content of its choosing; or
// create `sat-hud` first and *be* the HUD when the user next summoned it.
//
// So the registry below is the complete set of satellites, their geometry, and
// — the part that matters — the surface request each is allowed to be attached
// with. Nothing about a satellite except which one, and which in-app route it
// opens on, crosses the IPC boundary.
