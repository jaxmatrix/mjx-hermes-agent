//! Runtime binding to `libgtk-layer-shell` — the GTK3 wrapper around
//! `wlr-layer-shell` (MJXHRM-213).
//!
//! # Why dlopen instead of linking
//!
//! Linking would make the library a hard build dependency of every Linux build.
//! It is not installed as a `-dev` package on the development machine (there is
//! no `gtk-layer-shell-0` pkg-config entry), so `cargo build` would simply stop
//! working; and the library is useless on X11 and on GNOME-on-Wayland, which are
//! the majority of Linux desktops. Loading it at runtime turns a packaging
//! problem into a capability question, which is the whole point of this module's
//! parent: a machine without it *degrades*, it does not fail to build or fail to
//! start.
//!
//! # Why this is safe to call on a Tauri window
//!
//! `gtk_layer_init_for_window` must run **before the GtkWindow is realized**, and
//! Tauri owns window creation. It works out because tao 0.35.3
//! (`platform_impl/linux/window.rs`) ends `Window::new` with
//! `if attributes.visible { window.show_all() } else { window.hide() }`, and wry
//! 0.55.1 only calls `webview.show_all()` when the webview is visible. A window
//! built with `visible: false` therefore reaches us unrealized, children and all.
//! [`init_for_window`] still checks, because "must not be realized" is a
//! precondition we should enforce rather than assume.
//!
//! Every entry point here touches GDK and must run on the GTK main thread. This
//! module does not enforce that; its callers marshal via `run_on_main_thread`.
