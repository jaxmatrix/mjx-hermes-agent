//! `read_window_below` — what application is underneath our floating surface
//! (MJXHRM-213).
//!
//! # Why this is a per-OS capability rather than a library call
//!
//! There is no cross-platform way to ask "what is behind me". Wayland refuses on
//! principle: a client is not told about other clients' windows, and that is a
//! security property, not an omission. XWayland's `xprop` sees only X11 clients
//! and reports stacking that no longer means anything under a Wayland
//! compositor. So the answer has to come from whatever the *compositor* is
//! willing to say, and that is a different conversation on every desktop.
//!
//! This file is the **Hyprland** half of the answer, over its IPC socket — the
//! same choice the Electron desktop made, for the same reason. The other three
//! platforms enumerate a real z-order and live next door: [`super::x11`],
//! [`super::mac`] and [`super::win`], sharing the picker in
//! [`super::window_stack`] (MJXHRM-392). Which one runs is decided once, by
//! [`WindowBelowSource`], and the capability descriptor publishes that same
//! value — so a platform that cannot answer reports
//! [`Support::Unsupported`](super::Support) with a reason rather than returning
//! an empty answer that looks like "nothing is there".
//!
//! # Wire compatibility
//!
//! The JSON returned here is byte-for-byte the shape the backend's
//! `read_window_below` tool already parses (`tools/read_window_tool.py`), so the
//! gateway's `window.read.request` / `window.read.respond` round trip needs no
//! change. Metadata only — this never captures pixels.
