//! The device-unlock gate.
//!
//! Reading a stored credential should require the person at the keyboard to
//! prove they are the device's owner — Touch ID / Face ID, Windows Hello, or the
//! OS passcode as fallback. This module is the mechanism; `mod.rs` decides when
//! to apply it.
//!
//! **One unlock opens a window, it does not authorize one read.** A single SSH
//! connect reads the PEM, the passphrase and the password, so a per-read prompt
//! would fire three biometric dialogs for one action. The lease is
//! [`LEASE`] long and is dropped the moment the app is backgrounded or
//! suspended, so an unattended device does not sit unlocked.
//!
//! Two tiers of enforcement, and the difference is worth stating plainly rather
//! than implying uniformity:
//!
//! * **OS-enforced** — iOS and Android can bind the stored item itself to
//!   authentication (`kSecAccessControl`, a Keystore key with
//!   `setUserAuthenticationRequired`). There, bypassing this module does not get
//!   you the plaintext.
//! * **App-enforced** — Windows Credential Manager, the Linux Secret Service and
//!   the macOS *login* keychain have no per-item auth binding we can use. (macOS
//!   is here rather than above because the login keychain carries no
//!   `kSecAccessControl` for this bundle — that needs the Data Protection
//!   keychain, which needs an entitlement this bundle does not have; see
//!   `store::install`. With `store` sealing secrets under a key it holds for the
//!   process lifetime, that is doubly true.) The store is already user-bound, and
//!   the consent check happens here, at the boundary. That is a weaker claim and
//!   should be documented as one.
//!
//! Locking deliberately does NOT evict that macOS vault key. The lease governs
//! whether a credential may be READ; re-fetching the key on every lease expiry
//! would put a keychain password dialog behind the lease timer on exactly the
//! builds the vault exists to spare.
