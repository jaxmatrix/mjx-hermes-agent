//! An AES-256-GCM sealed map of account → secret, in one file.
//!
//! This exists because of how macOS authorizes access to the login keychain. Each
//! keychain item carries its own ACL, and the OS checks it PER ITEM and PER
//! DIRECTION — reading an item and writing it are two separate authorizations. On
//! a build whose code signature the ACL cannot bind to, every one of those checks
//! is a password dialog. Two stored credentials therefore cost four dialogs a
//! launch: read the cookie jar, read the token set, write the cookie jar back,
//! write the rotated token set back.
//!
//! Caching cuts repeats, and the branch that led here did exactly that. What it
//! cannot do is get below one dialog per item per direction, because each of those
//! is a first access to a distinct item.
//!
//! So: keep ONE keychain item — a random 32-byte key — and put every secret in a
//! file this key seals. One ACL check per launch, whatever the app stores and
//! however often it writes. The trade is explicit: the sealed file is protected by
//! a key in the keychain plus the filesystem's own permissions, rather than by an
//! ACL per secret. On this platform that ACL was never the load-bearing part —
//! the login keychain has no `kSecAccessControl` binding here (that needs a Data
//! Protection entitlement this bundle cannot carry, see `store::install`) — so
//! what is actually given up is the per-item dialog, which is the thing being
//! removed on purpose.
//!
//! Deliberately platform-agnostic and free of globals: it takes a key and a path
//! and does not know what a keychain is. The macOS wiring lives in
//! [`super::store`], and these tests run on every platform because a file format
//! that only its own target can exercise is a file format nobody checks.
