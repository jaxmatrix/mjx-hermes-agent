//!
//! The boundary is the point. Previously the webview drove the keyring plugin
//! directly, through commands whose account parameter was an arbitrary `String`,
//! granted to six window globs (`main`, `session-*`, `instance-*`, `tile-*`,
//! `sat-*`, `screen`). Any of those webviews could therefore read *any* entry —
//! including the `nativeAuth:<gateway>` bearer and refresh tokens that only
//! `oauth.rs` has business touching. Naming the readable set as a Rust enum, and
//! keeping the OAuth namespace off it entirely, is what closes that.
//!
//! Storage lives in `store`; this module owns *what may be named*.
