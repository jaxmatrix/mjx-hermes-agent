//! `download_file` — save a gateway file to a path the user picked.
//!
//! The workspace lives on the GATEWAY, not on this device, so "download" is a
//! network fetch plus a local write, not a copy. Both halves have to happen in
//! Rust:
//!
//! * **Auth.** The gateway authenticates either by session token (loopback
//!   mode) or by cookie (gated/OAuth mode). Only `/api/files/download` accepts
//!   a `?token=` query param at all (`_QUERY_TOKEN_API_PATHS` in
//!   `hermes_cli/web_server.py`), and in gated mode there is no token minted to
//!   put there — the SPA authenticates with a `SameSite=Lax` cookie that a
//!   webview subresource never carries. Reusing `TransportState`'s client gets
//!   the cookie jar, the registered connection's credentials (MJXHRM-446) and
//!   the native bearer for free.
//!
//! * **CSP + webview downloads.** The route this replaces read the file as a
//!   `data:` URL and did `fetch(dataUrl)` in JS — which the app CSP
//!   (`connect-src 'self' ipc:`, no `data:`) blocks — then handed the blob to a
//!   synthetic `<a download>`, which a wry/WKWebView shell does not reliably
//!   honour on mobile. Neither problem exists once the bytes never enter the
//!   webview.
//!
//! It also lifts the ceiling: the old `/api/fs/read-data-url` route caps at
//! 16 MB (`_FS_DATA_URL_MAX_BYTES`), while `/api/files/download` serves up to
//! 100 MB (`_MANAGED_FILE_MAX_BYTES`).
//!
//! The gateway target is `media.rs`'s — same host, same auth, same endpoint,
//! kept current by the `media_set_target` push in `src/lib/media-stream.ts`.
