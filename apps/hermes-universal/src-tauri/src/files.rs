//!   webview.
//!
//! It also lifts the ceiling: the old `/api/fs/read-data-url` route caps at
//! 16 MB (`_FS_DATA_URL_MAX_BYTES`), while `/api/files/download` has no size
//! ceiling at all now — the gateway used to 413 above `_MANAGED_FILE_MAX_BYTES`
//! and no longer does, because nothing on either side holds the file whole.
//!
//! **Nothing here is buffered.** The body is read one `chunk()` at a time into
//! `<dest>.part` and renamed into place at the end, so a 4 GB download costs one
//! chunk of memory rather than 4 GB. That is also what makes the two things
//! around it possible: a `{received, total}` progress event per ~100 ms (rule
//! 23's per-instance topic `hermes-download://{id}/progress` — the BYTES never
//! ride it, rule 24), and `cancel_download`, which flips an
//! `AtomicBool` the loop reads between chunks.
//!
//! `download_folder` is the same machinery pointed at
//! `/api/files/download-archive`, which streams a zip of a directory built on
//! the fly. That route is new, so a gateway that predates it must degrade
//! rather than error, and telling "this
//! gateway has no such route" from "that folder is gone" is what
//! [`archive_404_code`] does.
//!
//! The gateway target is `media.rs`'s — same host, same auth, same endpoint,
//! kept current by the `media_set_target` push in `src/lib/media-stream.ts`.
