//! Connection-level gateway OAuth (Track D3) — two flows, one command.
//!
//! # RFC 8252 native flow (preferred, MJXHRM-77)
//!
//! When `/api/status` advertises `auth_flows: [... "native_pkce"]` the gateway can
//! broker a real native-app login: client-side PKCE + a loopback redirect, ending in
//! bearer tokens handed to us in a JSON body with no cookie anywhere. That is
//! strictly better than the webview flow below:
//!
//!   * **No cookie plumbing.** Nothing has to be scraped out of a webview jar and
//!     replayed into reqwest; the gated middleware accepts
//!     `Authorization: Bearer` on every non-public route, ws-ticket included.
//!   * **The credential is ours.** We hold and rotate the refresh token
//!     (`/auth/native/refresh`) instead of depending on transparent cookie
//!     rotation we cannot see.
//!
//! Server side: `hermes_cli/dashboard_auth/routes.py` (`/auth/native/authorize`,
//! `/auth/native/token`, `/auth/native/refresh`) plus `native_flow.py`. The pure
//! half of the client — PKCE, state, URL building, callback parsing, token
//! parsing, refresh math — lives in [`native`] and is unit-tested; only the
//! socket/browser/HTTP I/O sits out here.
//!
//! ## Where the user types their password (the platform split)
//!
//! **Neither platform uses the system browser.** They differ only in WHICH webview
//! hosts the login: desktop builds a window beside the app, mobile takes over the
//! calling webview. Both then answer the same loopback listener, which is a plain
//! TCP socket and does not care which process connects to it.
//!
//! Both arms used to hand the authorize URL to the SYSTEM BROWSER, and the return
//! leg is why neither does now.
//!
//! On MOBILE it could never work: an app that opens Safari is backgrounded, and iOS
//! then SUSPENDS it — there is no `UIBackgroundModes`, no `beginBackgroundTask` and
//! `background.rs` is `cfg(desktop)`. A suspended process cannot accept on its own
//! loopback listener, so the redirect the browser makes to `127.0.0.1:<port>` hangs
//! until Safari gives up on an error page.
//!
//! On DESKTOP it worked on paper — we are never suspended, so the listener stays
//! live — but in practice the hop from the browser back to `127.0.0.1:<port>` is at
//! the mercy of things we do not control: a browser that refuses a plaintext
//! loopback navigation out of an https page, a proxy that eats the 302, an
//! extension. Hosting the login in our own window costs nothing (PKCE, the code
//! exchange and the keyring result are all unchanged) and removes that entire class
//! of failure.
//!
//! When the return leg does fail there is nothing to fall back on. The app does own
//! `hermes://` (MJXHRM-455), but the gateway will not redirect to a custom scheme
//! (see below), so the loopback socket is the only way home and `callback_response`
//! can only ask the user to switch back by hand. The token never reached the keyring and the user was left signed in inside
//! a browser we cannot read.
//!
//! A custom-scheme redirect would fix the return leg, but the gateway will not take
//! one: `_validate_loopback_redirect_uri` (`routes.py`) accepts ONLY
//! `http://127.0.0.1[:port]/…` / `http://[::1][:port]/…` and rejects even `localhost`.
//! So `ASWebAuthenticationSession` (which needs a custom callback scheme) is out
//! without a server change.
//!
//! What a webview CAN do is load our own loopback URL. So both arms point a webview
//! at the authorize URL, let the gateway 302 it to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback`
//! and answer that from the listener we already bound. The gateway's
//! `hermes_session_pkce` broker cookie round-trips inside that webview for both hops,
//! so nothing extra has to be plumbed.
//!
//!   * DESKTOP builds a dedicated `OAUTH_WINDOW_LABEL` window beside the app, waits
//!     on the listener, and closes the window. The app's own UI is never disturbed,
//!     so closing that window is also the cancel gesture — see
//!     `await_loopback_code_in_window`.
//!   * MOBILE navigates the CALLING webview, because neither phone can host a
//!     dismissable second window, then navigates back — the same navigate-away
//!     contract the cookie cascade below and `cloud.rs::portal_login` already use,
//!     one-shot resume marker included.
//!
//! # Legacy webview-cookie flow (fallback)
//!
//! Mirrors Hermes desktop (Electron), which binds an OAuth `BrowserWindow` to a
//! persistent session partition, runs the WHOLE login there, and polls that jar
//! for the session cookie. Tauri doesn't auto-share cookies between a webview and
//! reqwest, and the gateway's `redirect_uri` is always a same-origin
//! `{base}/auth/callback` https URL (never a custom scheme), so a deep-link
//! callback is impossible — and intercepting the callback to replay it via reqwest
//! is fragile on WebKitGTK (the redirect chain doesn't reliably fire
//! `on_navigation`/`on_page_load`).
//!
//! So we let the interactive webview complete the ENTIRE cascade itself
//! (`/auth/login` → IDP → `/auth/callback` → dashboard), which lands the session
//! cookies (`hermes_session_at`/`_rt`, HttpOnly) in the WEBVIEW's cookie jar, then:
//!
//!   1. Open a `WebviewWindow` at `{base}/auth/login?provider=X` (sets the
//!      webview's own PKCE cookie and goes straight to the provider).
//!   2. Poll the webview's cookie jar for `{base}` (`webview_cookies::cookies_for_base`)
//!      — on WebKitGTK this reads the libsoup/WebKit cookie manager (HttpOnly cookies
//!      included, unlike `document.cookie`) — until the session cookie appears.
//!   3. Import those cookies into the SHARED reqwest jar via `insert_raw`, so the
//!      ws-ticket mint (driven from JS via `http_request`) is authenticated. Then
//!      close the window.
//!
//! A timeout backstops the poll so a missed / abandoned login can't hang connect().
//!
//! The fallback is not dead weight: a gateway with only a password provider, or
//! any build older than the native routes, advertises no `native_pkce` and keeps
//! working exactly as before.
