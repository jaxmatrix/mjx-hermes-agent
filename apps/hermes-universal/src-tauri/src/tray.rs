//! The system tray (desktop): the only affordance that reaches a hidden Hermes.
//!
//! Background mode is what makes this load-bearing rather than decorative. Once
//! the window can be put away without the process ending, something has to be
//! able to bring it back and something has to be able to end it — so the tray is
//! a hard dependency of `background::set_background_mode`, not a nicety beside
//! it. `install` therefore reports whether it actually got an icon, and a `false`
//! is what makes the Settings switch refuse to arm.
//!
//! **The labels are pushed, not read.** Every string the user sees lives in the
//! JS catalog (`src/i18n/*.ts`, five locales), and a native menu cannot reach it
//! — there is no bundle on this side and no React to re-render when the locale
//! changes. So this follows the split the app already uses everywhere the
//! webview owns copy and Rust owns a native lever: the menu is BUILT with
//! English literals, so the first paint is never blank or keyed, and the shell
//! pushes the translated set over `tray_set_labels` at boot and again whenever
//! `display.language` changes. `tray_set_status` does the same for the
//! connection readout, which is a disabled row — a readout, not a button.

// Desktop implementation. The whole tray, its menu handles and its two setters.
