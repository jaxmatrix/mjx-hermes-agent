# Universal Engineering Guide

How to build Hermes Universal (Tauri, desktop + Android/iOS from one React app)
well. Read it with the repository `AGENTS.md` — the root rules still apply — and
with `apps/desktop/AGENTS.md`, whose seams and state rules universal shares.

When a rule here and the code disagree, trust the code and fix whichever is
wrong.

## Commands

**npm, never pnpm or yarn** — this repo is one npm workspace tree pinned by the
root `package-lock.json` (see the root `AGENTS.md`). This package is
`@hermes/universal`, so every script below also works from the repo root as
`npm run <script> --workspace @hermes/universal`.

```bash
npm run tauri dev     # desktop shell (pair with `npm run dev`, Vite on 5176)
npm run android:dev   # Android; ios:build:debug / dev:ios for iOS
npm test              # vitest (this package only)
npm run check         # the full gate: check:js (typecheck, lint, test, build),
                      #   check:i18n, cargo fmt --check, cargo check, cargo test
```

`npm run check` is the one to run before calling a change done — it covers both
halves, and the Rust half is easy to forget because nothing in the JS tooling
touches `src-tauri/`. Keep `check` a pure umbrella over its `check:<name>`
sub-scripts: CI runs each sub-script as its own job and never the plain `check`.
`README.md` has the full script table and the several-shells-on-one-dev-server
workflow (`dev:ext:*`).

## `position: fixed` is not above the soft keyboard

On the mobile webviews Tauri embeds, the on-screen keyboard does **not**
reliably shrink the layout viewport — it is drawn over it. `bottom: 0` therefore
means "the bottom of the screen, behind the keyboard", not "the bottom of what
the user can see".

`hooks/use-keyboard-inset.ts` measures the real geometry off the Visual Viewport
API and publishes it to `:root`:

| var / attribute            | meaning                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `--keyboard-inset`         | px the keyboard occludes at the bottom         |
| `--visual-viewport-height` | height of the actually-visible region          |
| `--visual-viewport-top`    | its offset from the top of the layout viewport |
| `data-keyboard-open`       | on `<html>` while the keyboard is up (`keyboard-open:` variant) |

The phone's `#root` is **pinned to the visible rectangle** — `position: fixed`
at `--visual-viewport-top`, `--visual-viewport-height` tall (`styles.css`,
`html.is-mobile:not([data-hud]) #root`). WKWebView reveals a focused caret by
*scrolling the visual viewport*, so a shell anchored to the layout viewport gets
carried off the top of the screen; taking the rectangle instead means anything
in flow inside a shell is handled for free, keyboard included, and the shells
must NOT also lift themselves with a `--keyboard-inset` margin. Never give that
rule a `transform` / `contain` / `filter` / `backdrop-filter` / `will-change` —
it would become the containing block for the fixed surfaces below, which are
already pinned to the same rectangle.

Two kinds of element are not covered by it:

1. **Anything `position: fixed`.** `#root` being fixed does not make it their
   containing block, so they still resolve against the layout viewport. Anchor
   one with `bottom: var(--keyboard-inset, 0px)`, or size it from
   `--visual-viewport-height` / `--visual-viewport-top` when it must fill the
   visible region.
2. **Anything in a portal** — every Radix overlay (`Sheet`, `Dialog`,
   `Popover`, `DropdownMenu`) mounts on `<body>`, outside `#root`, even when the
   JSX sits inside a shell.

`SheetContent side="bottom"` already does this; a bottom sheet needs nothing
extra. A new fixed or portalled surface that can hold a focused field does — and
the bug is invisible on desktop, where these vars are absent and resolve to 0.

Pair the lift with a ceiling: a surface lifted by the keyboard can otherwise run
off the top of the screen with no way to scroll back to it. `max-height:
calc(var(--visual-viewport-height, 100vh) - <gutter>)` plus `overflow-y: auto`.

Same shape, different inset: `lib/safe-area.ts` republishes
`--safe-area-inset-*` because the webviews resolve `env()` a few frames late.
Read the vars, never `env()` directly. Note that a bar sitting at the bottom of
the visible rectangle (or lifted by `--keyboard-inset`) should not also pad by
the bottom safe-area inset while the keyboard is up — the home indicator is
behind the keyboard, and counting both leaves a dead band. `keyboard-open:` /
`--composer-dock-inset-bottom` in `styles.css` is how the composer does it.
